The News
========

\multicols{2}

__Google, by Alphabet.__  Google (the conglomerate) has become
Alphabet, the conglomerate.  Alphabet will retain all existing Google
operations.  The Google subsidiary will be led by current Product
Chief Sundar Pichai.  Freed from the Google brand, Alphabet may better
manage the increasingly bizarre and loosely-coupled stable, keeping
speculative ventures siloed from the cash cows: ads and search.

__Administrative death pronounced freely.__  Australian infosec
researcher Chris Rock will kill you---on paper.  After supplying
another doctor's registration number, obtained from a public record,
Rock obtained an account on Australia's online registry and found he
was able to kill and give 'birth' to any person in any state or
territory.  All submissions must be verified by a funeral director, so
he hacked up a website for a fake business and was promptly given a
second account.  This is Fairly Bad.

__Firefox vulnerability.__  A critical vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox
has been found, leading to significant data loss.  Exploits will find
themselves able to access arbitrary files on the host system,
including emails, password vaults, private keys, you name it.  Update
to 39.0.3 immediately to avoid catastrophe.

__Microsoft embiggens bug bounty.__  If you happen to have any novel
exploitation techniques lying around for shiny new Windows 10,
Microsoft have bumped their maximum bug bounty to US$135k. Of course,
bug bounties are about a lot more than the headline rate.  Many
software vendors will pay out the nose for small vulnerabilities, and
these programs are open to all, including you.  Check out Microsoft's
program at [`https://aka.ms/BugBounty`](https://aka.ms/BugBounty) and
head to BugCrowd if you'd like to break non-Redmond things for dosh.

__Go x86, get negative rings.__  Researcher Christopher Domas, speaking
at Black Hat, has demonstrated an attack on older x86 chipsets able to
grant access to ring -2.  A successful attacker would see their
arbitrary code executed as if it were Intel firmware, with powers
above and beyond the OS, and the ability to persist long after the OS
is reinstalled.  Chipsets from Sandy Bridge onward (~2012) should be
safe.  Those with older hardware shouldn't panic, as the attack is
quite difficult to pull off in practice---just not difficult enough to
prevent the nightmares.

__WiFi talk and VoLTE.__ The wireless spectrum will be breathing a
sigh of relief this week, as Optus announce voice and text over WiFi,
a change that will reduce reliance on cell towers while remaining
transparent to the user.  Competitors appear to have similar things in
the works.  Meanwhile, Telstra seems busy making Voice over LTE
happen.  Who cares, really?  I just ran out of news items, and this
was the best of a few bad options.  We are very reliant on some very
crowded channels of the spectrum.  OK, column over. Bye
