Brain Teasers
-------------

A.
:    Using a 5 liter jug, a 3 liter jug, and a hose, can you measure 1
     litre of water?

B.
:    How about 4 litres?

C.
:   You are given 12 coins of equal size and shape; one of them is a
    fake. We do not know if it is heavier or lighter than the others,
    but want to find out. Can you determine which one is a fake and if
    it is lighter or heavier by weighing coins on a balance scale a
    maximum of three times?

Issue 108 Solutions
-------------------

__Brain Teasers__

__A.__ Yes; for example, quines must have access to their own source
codes to print them.

__B.__ Turn the first one on and wait a few minutes, then turn it off
and turn the second one on. Go down. If the light bulbs are hot but
off, it was the first one, if they're on, its the second, and if
they're neither its the third. Alternatively, if your servers are set
up correctly then you should be notified when they come online and
shouldn't need to go down at all.

__Bonus.__ A canary with the super-user password.
