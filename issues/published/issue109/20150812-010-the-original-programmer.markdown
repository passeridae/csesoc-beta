The Original Programmer
=======================

\multicols{2}

Picture in your mind who you think was the first ever programmer.

If you know a little about the history of computing, you would think this programmer to be an American, most likely working for the military.  It's true that the US military gave us email and the internet, two things that now rule our lives, and Alan Turing's work with the British forces in World War II layed the foundations for the modern computer.  However, the origin of Computer Science has a more romantic background to it, and it starts with the only legitimate child of the famous English poet, Lord Byron.

Augusta Ada Gordon was the daughter of a brief and unhappy marriage between George Gordon, Lord of Byron, and Isabelle Milbanke.  She was born in London on December 10th, 1815 and never knew her father, as her parents separated and her father left the country four months after her birth.  Detesting the notion that Ada would become anything like her father, Milblanke brought up Ada as a student of science, mathematics and music---seen as the time to be the logical schools of thought, as far away as possible from poetry.  Milblanke also forced her daughter to lie completely still for extended periods of time, believing that this would develop self-control.

Indeed, the diet of critical thinking and logic worked.  As young as 13, Ada was known to produce designs for flying machines and boats, which were dominating the pages of newspapers in the midst of the industrial revolution.  Ada was given access to tutoring in mathematics and science, and her and Lady Byron often interacted with the noblemen in society who were studying the sciences of botany, geology and astronomy.

At the age of 17, Ada, along with her mentor and friend Mary Somerville, put on their most beautiful dresses---as was to be expected from noblewomen---and set out for a night on the town in London.  Ada had become somewhat of a character on the dancefloors of London, inheriting her father's charm and making plenty of friends.  During this particular night out, they ran into a friend of Somerville: Charles Babbage, Lucasian Chair of Mathematics at Cambridge.  Babbage had already become a small time celebrity, and his work in calculating machines interested Ada greatly, as it was the intersection of her passion for mathematics, and the design of machines.  Ada and Charles quickly became friends through their shared passions, and remained friends up until Ada's death.

Babbage saw the potential in Ada, and set her up studying Advanced Mathematics with a friend of his, the University of London's Augustus de Morgan. At age 19, Ada married her family's physician, William King, and when King became the Earl of Lovelace, Ada became better known as 'Ada Lovelace'.  Lovelace remained fascinated by Babbage's "Difference Engine"---a machine that would compute the values of polynomial functions.  But the difference engine was never finished, and Babbage decided to shift his focus to a more complex machine: one that would be programmable by punch cards.  He developed the concepts, and part of the implementation for the machine, together with Lovelace, however funding was hard to come by for a second machine, while his first remained unfinished.

Lovelace had well and truly earned the respect of Babbage, as well as multiple noblemen by this point.  Babbage would refer to her as "The Enchantress of Numbers", based of some of his own musings, where Lovelace was described as, "_that Enchantress who has thrown her magical spell around the most abstract of Sciences and has grasped it with a force which few masculine intellects could have exerted over it._"  Babbage had also gained some followers in Italy, which further brought Lovelace into the fold, as she spoke Italian.

In 1842, at age 27, Lovelace was asked to translate a paper written about Babbage's new machine, the Analytical Engine from Italian to English.  Not only did she translate the paper, but she added her own notes as well, which ended up being three times as long as the paper itself.  Lovelace says, "_The Analytical Engine, on the contrary, is not merely adapted for tabulating the results of one particular function and of no other, but for developing and tabulating any function whatever.  In fact the engine may be described as being the material expression of any indefinite function of any degree of generality and complexity._"

Her notes included the first ever algorithm for the first ever programmable computer, which makes Ada Lovelace the first ever Computer Programmer.  She goes on to devise the concept of loops, and even predict future uses of the machines: "_Again, it might act upon other things besides number... Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent._"

The paper was published, in English, under the unassuming title, "_Sketch of The Analytical Engine, Invented by Charles Babbage, By L. F. MENABREA of Turin.  With notes upon the Memoir by the Translator A.A.L_"---standing for, of course, Augusta Ada Lovelace.  Only her initials were originally published, to hide her gender.

Sadly, this was to be Ada's peak.  Throughout the 1840s, her life became dominated by rumors and scandal, of affairs with many men, and of a large gambling debt.  She died in November of 1852 from uterine cancer, aged 36, and was buried next to her father, whom she never knew.  Babbage's Analytical Engine was never finished.

As much as we all wish that this story had a happier ending, all we are left to do is pick up the pieces and learn as much as we can from them.  Today, a programming language developed by the US military is named Ada in her honour.  'Ada Lovelace Day` is celebrated on the 13th of October and recognises the achievements of women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.  Her work is thought to have been the inspiration behind Turing's work a century later.  And we can all see her legacy whenever we use a computer, phone, tablet or smart-watch, as it's likely that none of these would have been programmable if not for her.  It really is funny to think how a few drinks with a stranger in a pub in London changed the course of history, and sad it is that women are so under-represented in a field pioneered by a woman.
