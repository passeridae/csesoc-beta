__Malware Madness!__
Ransomware hits OS X after Transmission, a popular BitTorrent client,
got pwn'd.  Apple moved quickly to revoke the code-signing certificate
used for the app, but not quite quickly enough, with another spate of
hungry hackers holding boxes for ransom.

__Inventor of E-mail Dies.__
Ray Tomlinson, who developed a small system for transmitting messages
between users on different computers, passed away last week, aged 74.
Until his work in 1971–72, electronic mail between networked hosts
just wasn't possible.

__Creator of R2-D2 Dies.__
Tony Dyson, special-effects supervisor for the _Star Wars_ franchise,
and creator of everyone's favourite 'droid, passed away aged 68.

__Google Becomes moot Point.__
Founder of 4chan, Christopher `moot` Poole, who last year retired from
that post, has announced he's joined Google in an as-yet undisclosed
position, confirmed separately by their VP of Streams, Photos and
Sharing.

__systemctl start ms-sql-server.service__
Microsoft have annouced a port of their SQL Server product to Linux,
for release in mid-2017.  Furthering the radical about-face on policy
from the company that once likened Linux to cancer, SQL Server joins a
line-up of other products in the non-Windows and open-source space,
including the recent Azure Cloud Switch OS, their work on getting
Linux and FreeBSD up on Hyper-V, and their newly-minted membership of
the Eclipse Foundation.

__Basslink Woes.__
Tasmania's main Internet link to the mainland will shut down as
repairs on Basslink, the undersea HVDC/darkfibre link from Victoria,
continue.  Basslink have, at last, located the fault that cut Tassie
power off late last year, and will hopefully bring the island state
back online... soon.

__Hyper-Definition Olympics.__
The Olympic Broadcasting Service is touting virtual reality recordings
of "one key event each day" during the 2016 Olympic Games, a more
realistic counterpoint to the 22.2-channel surround sound and 8K video
recordings they also promise.

__AI "close to the territory of divinity."__
Lee Sedol was last week routed by Google DeepMind's AlphaGo AI in a
thrilling five-match series in South Korea, with the AI taking four
matches in ways described by top Go players and national Go
federations as highly unusual.  Lee forced a 'simple' mistake to take
the fourth game but for the most part the AI played strong games.
AlphaGo was awarded an honorary 9th dan by the Korea Baduk
Association, the highest normally awarded professional ranking, and
received $1m for the series win, with DeepMind donating it to
charities.

__Alphabet to flog Boston Dynamics.__
Yet, on the back of their AI win, Google's parent company Alphabet is
reportedly looking to divest robotics startup Boston Dynamics, likely
to Toyota or Amazon.  Speculation is that, like Google Glass, the
less-than-glowing real world reviews are the cause.
