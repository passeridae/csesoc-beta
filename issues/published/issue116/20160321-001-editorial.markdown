Editorial
=========

\multicols{2}

Hello all, and welcome to another edition of Beta. I was hoping for an influx of 
wonderful written works this week, but alas it seems everyone is getting stuck into 
uni (or editing) instead! A magazine without content is like bread without flour; 
difficult, and rather dry. If you're stuck for ideas, why don't you join the Beta 
Facebook group (under CSESoc Beta), or our magical mailing list, or even come along 
to a meetup! We don't bite, and you may even come away inspired.

Alternatively, email me, your friendly Beta head. I'm always keen to chat about 
ideas, or hand out writing tips if you'd like to hear them! Let me know that I'm not 
shouting into the void (that would be cool of you).

On an unrelated note, this edition of Beta is brought to you by hospital waiting 
rooms. Enjoy!
