12 April
:    Emacs Workshop\hfill\bcalTech{}
     _11--12pm, Seminar Room (first floor of the K17 building)_

    If you want an editor that's extensible, flexible, graphical, and helpful, why 
    not try Emacs?

    This workshop introduces Emacs as a day-to-day tool to write and edit text and 
    code, and shows some sweet shortcuts to make your life easier. Like other 
    editors, it's got a lots of power tucked away under the hood, and it can even 
    help you scale its learning curve.

    If you've never used Emacs before, that's cool! We don't assume you've 
    experienced it yet, and if you have, that's great too. We do assume you have a 
    recent GNU Emacs installed; if you've got a Mac, Aqumacs is cool too.
