Brain Teasers

A:   Richard Buckland orders his three grad students to assemble and declares that he will 
     select his favourite grad student to fix the uptime problem on Open 
     Learning. In order to win this great honour, the grad students must play a 
     game that works as follows: the grad students all close their eyes as Richard 
     Buckland places a hat on their heads, and hear that 
     each hat is either white or blue. At least one grad student is wearing a blue 
     hat. The students are able to see the colour of each others hat, but not their 
     own and are strictly forbidden from talking to each other. The first grad 
     student to announce the colour of his or her own hat will have the privelage of 
     spending the next several weeks engaged in dialogue with MongoDB. After a few  
     minutes, one of the grad students stands and announces the colour of her hat. 
     What did she say, and how did she know?
     Note: It is known that Richard Buckland is extremely fair, thus all the grad students 
     have an equyal chance of winning. Furthermore, you can assume that all the grad 
     students have a desire to win (poor, misguided creatures).  

B:   I have two children, The youngest is a girl. What is the probability they are
     both girls? (Hint: Its not 50%)

__Brain Teasers__

A:    In a similar manner to the XOR solution, we can use simple addition and 
      subtraction: a = a + b; b = a - b; a = a - b;

B:    Many people rush to 42, but this is not in fact the answer to everything (life 
      and the universe, on the other hand...). However, if person A shakes hands 
      with person B, the inverse (B shaking hands with A) will not occur. Therefore, 
      the solution is 7+6+5+4+3+2+1=21!
