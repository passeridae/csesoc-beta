The News
========

\multicols{2}

__GNU/Windows?!__
The biggest news out of Microsoft lately is the freshly-released
native Linux environment on Windows 10, allowing users to try
Ubuntu right out of the box.  This follows hot on the news that
Xamarin, the company built by the creators of Mono and snaffled up
last week by Microsoft, was being open sourced.

__We're DOOMed!__
id Software will be releasing an open beta of the long-awaited new
_Doom_, scheduled to launch officially in May.  It enters open beta on
April 15 and wraps up on April 17, but is available to all on all
platforms.

__WhatsApp encrypted end-to-end.__
In conjunction with Open Whisper Systems, the massive messaging
platform WhatsApp has rolled out end-to-end encryption across its
plethora of active devices and platforms, based on the Signal
protocol.  Fantastic!

__Chrome extensions defacto standard?__
Last August, Mozilla announced the Firefox extensions platform would
be going away in favour of WebExtensions, a Chrome-alike API.  And at
the tail end of March, Microsoft announced that they would be building
tools to do the same in Edge.

__Catch an Uber bug-bounty!__
Uber is starting a 90-day bug bounty program from May 1, reaching out
to the white-hat community with up to $10k per bug, a loyalty program,
and a "treasure map".

__xkcd Making Science Fun.__
US publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt's 2017 editions of their
chemistry, biology and physics textbooks will feature illustrations
from Randall Munroe, creator of xkcd and author of _Thing Explainer_.

__'Tick, Tock' goes the clock... but Intel changes tack.__
Fab-ulous chip-maker Intel is switching away from its "tick-tock"
microprocessor strategy---a die-shrink on the 'tick' and a
microarchitecture refresh on the 'tock' over two product cycles---to a
new, three-step plan, labelled 'process-architecture-optimization',
due to the increasing difficulty of shrinking silicon lithography.

__Swift lands on Linux.__
Swift, Apple's Objective-C killer, has landed on Ubuntu, with official
binaries of the Swift 2.2 release shipped for Ubuntu.  It still lacks
the 'core libraries', but has the LLVM project's 'lldb' debugger, and
the REPL.

__April is Android Month.__
A whole slew of new Android devices, including the LG G5, Xiaomi Mi 5,
Samsung Galaxy S7, Huawei P9, Meizu M3, HTC 10, Oppo R9, Zopo Speed 8,
and new Sony Xperia handsets, all land in April by happy coincidence
of the software turnaround from the 'gold master' Android, and the
hardware turnaround of the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 820, both released
late in 2015.

__Virtual becomes Reality: Oculus Rift shipping.__
If you preordered the fantastic VR headset in January, good news!
Your shiny new Oculus Rift headset is shipping now, with a current
lead time of three months on new orders.  The Oculus Rift, which rose
to fame from its Kickstarter in late 2012, has had several development
previews released over the last three years.

__Call Sweden!__
The Swedish Tourist Association has launched "The Swedish Number", a
real phone number you can call to reach... Sweden.  A random Swedish
person (who, thankfully, will have signed up for the service) will
answer when you call +46 771 793 336 (that's +46 771 SWEDEN), and talk
to you about Sweden.

__Self-balancing scooters banned.__
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, acting after a
number of disasterous failures of 'hoverboards' or self-balancing
scooters causing smoke, fires, and explosions, has finally issued an
interim ban of the devices, following over twenty safety recall
notices due to defective safety measures in their charging systems.
