Are you Seeing This Too?: The Mr Robot Review
=============================================

\multicols{2}

Hello friend. Hello, friend?

And right off the bat, Mr Robot addresses the anxiety and insecurity that is so prevalent in the industry. Thing is though, this 
show isn’t trying to provide a commentary on life in the Tech Industry (that’s what ßeta is for!)

Mr Robot is an award winning drama that just finished its first season. The plot of the show centres around Elliot Alderson 
(Rami Malek), who is a professional security engineer by day, vigilante hacker by night. The series opens to him in his 
therapist's office, talking about his frustrations with society.

“Oh, I don't know. Is it that we collectively thought Steve Jobs was a great man, even when we knew he made billions off the 
backs of children? Or maybe it's that it feels like all our heroes are counterfeit. The world itself is just one big hoax. 
Spamming with our running commentary of bullshit masquerading as insight, our social media faking as intimacy. Or is it that we
voted for this? Not with our rigged elections, but with our things, our property, our money. I'm not saying anything new. 
We all know why we do this, not because Hunger Games books makes us happy but because we wanna be sedated. Because it's painful
not to pretend, because we're cowards. Fuck society.” 

Over the course of the first season, Elliot is taken on an adventure by the mysterious Mr Robot (Christian Slater) where they 
attempt to bring down “E Corp”, a multinational conglomerate that seems to control banks, social media, retail stores, almost 
every part of your life. How are they going to take them down? They’re going to hack them.

I can hear you all groaning now, NCIS’s “Two Idiots, One Keyboard” playing in your minds. But as you watch Mr Robot, you slowly 
come to the horrifying realisation that somebody involved in the production of the show seriously knows what they are doing. 
It’s the little things that make the difference, like when Elliott uses a python script to run an exploit, or when two of the 
main characters have a discussion about the KDE and Gnome window managers, or when Elliot is being asked to hack something 
overnight, and he says “That will take months of research”. It’s clear there was a lot of consulting in the security industry 
that went into this, and it makes the show feel really authentic.

The strongest part of Mr Robot, though, is that it makes you think. If you wanted a TV show where you can turn your brain off, 
mess around on your phone while watching and still get the entire plotline from half paying attention, go watch something else. 
In this show, every interaction, every word is intentionally placed by Writer, Director and part time lurker on /r/MrRobot, Sam 
Esmail. The result is a show with enough action, drama and sex to get the general public into it and enough gory technical 
details to get the nerds into it. I wouldn’t call it “fun for the whole family”, but I would call it “bloody brilliant 
television”.
