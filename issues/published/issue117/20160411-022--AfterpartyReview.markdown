Afterparty: The Afterparty Review
=================================

\multicols{2}

If I had to pick one piece of fiction for you to read this year, “Afterparty” is it.


Published in 2014 by Daryl Gregory (author of such gems as “We Are All Completely Fine” and “Harrison Squared”), and set after the
smart drug revolution, “Afterparty” follows the journey of Lyda Rose. Lyda is a neuroscientist turned mental patient who sets out
on a quest to find who is producing a drug called ‘Numinous’ after a fellow patient dies while withdrawing from it. ‘Numinous’ is 
the drug behind the book’s tagline of “take a pill, get a god”.

The central concept explored in this novel is the mind; specifically the interrelationship between neuroscience, drug development, 
and perception. Lyda acts as the central connection between the objective and subjective in the novel; she was a key part of the 
research group that developed ‘Numinous’ (a drug intended to cure schizophrenia), but suffered an overdose and is now stuck with
a hallucinatory angel known as Dr Gloria. As the book states; “There was a scientist who did not believe in gods or fairies or 
supernatural creatures of any sort. But she had once known an angel, and had talked to her every day”.

The neuroscience presented in the novel is one of its high points; highly accurate, entertainingly packaged, and intrinsically 
tied into the story’s progression. Recent research in neural representation is poetically explained; “The brain is a 
collective, a huge number of... thinking modules. It doesn’t make a decision, it arrives at one”. As well as this, 
neurochemical responses to stimuli are both accurate and amusing to read; “Dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin—the whole 
damn monoamine family—kicked in like a band of mustangs”. Overall, the presentation of science guides the reader to 
understanding both the brain itself and the story that is unfolding. Suitable even for people with a non scientific background, 
scientific concepts are presented like sub-stories, and are thus inherently accessible. 

All in all, Lyda’s quest through neuroscience and her own mind is an intensely engaging read, and I would recommend this book to 
anyone (and everyone) interested in brains, gods, and how science has the potential to change us.
