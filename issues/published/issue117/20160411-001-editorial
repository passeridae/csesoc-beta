Editorial
=========

Hello, and welcome to the reviews edition of Beta! I truly have no idea which stars 
aligned, but align they did and this week we bring you reviews of three, yes three, 
interesting texts as read/watched by those in CSE. In case you feel that your life 
is bare and you have too much free time between assignments, pick one up and see how 
it goes. I for one, like to attempt to spite time mamagement as much as possible and 
will be looking at Jeff VanDerMeer's novel shortly. Maybe I'll even read it.

In more national news, it turns out that this year's census will not be anonymous and there 
are a lot of people who aren't very happy about that. Roger Clarke is included, 
with such advice as avoiding being a resident of a house, and asking questions. For other tips, see his site at http://www.rogerclarke.com/DV/Census-2016.html#What.
