Alternatives to your Tech Career
================================

\multicols{2}

Nobody ever said you HAD to use computers. Computers ruin lives, and
let hackers into your home.  Had you even heard of hackers before you
started to use computers?  Didn't think so.  It's no coincidence.
It's not too late.  Your past does not define your future.  Many folks
graduate from degrees in computing and go on to live productive,
computer-free lives.  Some of them paint, and some of them surf, for
instance.

This $\beta$eta listicle is all about options.  Your options.  You
have a lot of options, and you need to think carefully before walking
headlong into the quicksort hellworld that is a career in tech.


Goat life
---------

{\it We're not kidding.}\end{center}

Maybe you read a little about Thomas Thwaites, a British designer who,
for a time in 2015, ran among the goats. He gave himself wonderful
little prosthetic goat legs and hung out in the hills eating grass and
balancing on awkward slopes. Goat life could be for you. Goats live on
a diet of grass and rock mountain garbage, and there's no shortage of
the stuff. Goat life will take you places, including up rocky
mountains in search of moss and natural fungus, and if you move well
among them they may let you into the top-secret Goat Tower. The only
graphs in goat life are the powerful bonds of herd kinship, and the
only ISAs are Independent Strong Animals.

You might think that computers would help with goat matters, like
figuring out where the grass grows best, or where the coolest
mountains are, but you'd be wrong.


Bat life
--------

If you like to sit in the dark and screech a lot, consider the bat
life. Bats love to hang out, all the time, often upside down, which
may be of interest to you. Your command line skills may translate well
to bat life, as a good bat can command a powerline without dying
sometimes. Bats can mess with stuff that skywriters write in the sky,
if they want to. Hollywood wants you to believe that dressing up like
a bat is for angry billionaires acting out male power fantasies. This
is because they want the bat life all for themselves. You could also
live in a tree or whatever. If you played Pok√©mon, you probably
knocked out a heck of a lot of Zubats, so you are kind of obliged to
do this.


Shark life
----------

It is often said that computers belong on the bottom of the
ocean. However, have you even tried putting a computer into the ocean?
It just sinks, and then gets to hang out under the sea. Many fun
characters live under the sea, such as Mr Sparkle and Patrick
Star. The computers will have fun down there. This cannot happen. You
can only imagine the partying that will go on when we put the rest of
the industry down there. Software will eat the world, probably, but
you could eat the bro-CEOs destroying the earth. Sharks answer to
no-one. All fin, no ack. This is also the only career path that
involves eating famed Soylent creator Rob Rhinehart. Consider shark
life.


Carmack life
------------

You don't have to create DOOM, or be John Carmack, to become John
Carmack. Anyone can be John Carmack with the right Carmack aesthetic
and related accessories. Though John Carmack may choose to compute,
you, as a Carmack, will not have to do anything you do not want to
do. No more Unix, no more shell scripts. Nothing but you time. Carmack

Sadly, it probably won't even have enough gas to make it to the first
border crossing.
