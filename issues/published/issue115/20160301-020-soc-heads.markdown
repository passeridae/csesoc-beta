The CSESoc Team, 2016
=====================

\begin{center}\vspace{-1ex}
{\large\it Meet your society team!}
\end{center}
\multicols{2}

Co-Presidents
-------------

\begin{center}
\tikz\node[circle,inner sep=.125\linewidth,fill overzoom image=images/lav.jpg] (A) {};
\tikz\node[circle,inner sep=.125\linewidth,fill overzoom image=images/jake.jpg] (A) {};

{\it \textbf{Lavender~Chan} \\
  \& \textbf{Jake~Bloom}}
\end{center}

Leading your society this year are two powerhouses of, well, power: 
Jake "The Mighty Waratahs" Bloom, who can be found in a singlet and boardies
 telling us all about sports (just don't mention e-sports),
and Lavender "I'm Actually A Cat" Chan, who really, really, _really_ loves
cats.

Lavender and Jake are already off to a flying start, bringing on board
a raft of new sponsors, and preparing the team for a busy year ahead.

Secretary
---------

\begin{center}
\tikz\node[circle,inner sep=.125\linewidth,fill overzoom image=images/carmen.jpg] (A) {};

{\it \textbf{Carmen~Wang}}
\end{center}

With the aid of her mighty enforcer, Carmen keeps everyone honest and
organised in the role of secretary.  Keeping tabs on everything and
everyone, you can count on her to know the minutiae of any and all
goings-on of the society. 

Treasurer
---------

\begin{center}
\tikz\node[circle,inner sep=.125\linewidth,fill overzoom image=images/steven.jpg] (A) {};

{\it \textbf{Steven~Strijakov}}
\end{center}

Pioneering efforts in reducing CSESoc's funding footprint by moving 
the print to his own feet (don't ask), 
Steven brings to the table all his skill and ingenuity to
keeping the weekly barbecue funded. 10 points to Griffindor
for pronouncing his name right on your first try.

Arc Delegate
------------

\begin{center}
\tikz\node[circle,inner sep=.125\linewidth,fill overzoom image=images/david.jpg] (A) {};

{\it \textbf{David~Sison}}
\end{center}

David has a creative mind, and often enjoys narrating in games of Mafia, 
which may result in a dinosaur serial killer who chooses to oven his victims. 
And, oh yes, if you look at him at just the right
angle, in just the right light, you might catch a glimpse of his inner
Jackie Chan.

Social Heads
------------

\begin{center}
\tikz\node[circle,inner sep=.125\linewidth,fill overzoom image=images/george.jpg] (A) {};
\tikz\node[circle,inner sep=.125\linewidth,fill overzoom image=images/jath.jpg] (A) {};

{\it \textbf{George~Mountakis} \\
  \& \textbf{Jathurson~Subachandran}}
\end{center}

Two classy individuals are the masterminds of a whole raft of
spectacular events, including our weekly barbecue, and in just a few
weeks, First Year Camp.

These individuals are he inimitable George, who still hasn't been found since the last
time he was running shirtless around the Village Green howling
(and who still can only be kept calm with the quadratic
formula in iambic pentameter), and the indefatigable Jathurson,
who, thankfully, _knows_ the quadratic formula in iambic pentameter,
and in his off-time, causes small volcanic eruptions off the coast.

Publicity Head
--------------

\begin{center}
\tikz\node[circle,inner sep=.125\linewidth,fill overzoom image=images/nicola.jpg] (A) {};

{\it \textbf{Nicola~Gibson}}
\end{center}

Nicola is _still_ active in just about everything, and this year,
she's carrying the mantle of Publicity head, so just about everything
of CSESoc's that looks good can probably be attributed to her,
somehow.

Beta Head
---------

\begin{center}
\tikz\node[circle,inner sep=.125\linewidth,fill overzoom image=images/emily.jpg] (A) {};

{\it \textbf{Emily~Olorin}}
\end{center}

Emily has immense difficulty talking about herself in the third
person. She is not a) A brick, b) A series of cats jammed into human clothing, 
c) A good juggler, d) Queen of the internet, e) A tentacled monster, lurking in the deep.


Dev Head
--------

\begin{center}
\tikz\node[circle,inner sep=.125\linewidth,fill overzoom image=images/nick.jpg] (A) {};

{\it \textbf{Nicholas~Whyte}}
\end{center}

Nicholas maintains a mop of hair as a protective shield while doing
server maintenance, and, and, given that he maintains a server called
GLaDOS, it's little wonder that it's necessary.

He's also the goto person when it comes to the CSESoc website or Bark,
even though he regularly reminds us that goto is considered harmful.

CompClub Head
-------------

\begin{center}
\tikz\node[circle,inner sep=.125\linewidth,fill overzoom image=images/joseph.jpg] (A) {};

{\it \textbf{Joseph~Hilsberg}}
\end{center}

Joseph is a key person in bringing the magic of computer science to
high schools, with CompClub.  Unfortunately, due to budget cuts, the
entire team and all their equipment must fit on his bicycle to get
from school to school.

\columnbreak

DevSpace Head
-------------

\begin{center}
\tikz\node[circle,inner sep=.125\linewidth,fill overzoom image=images/john.jpg] (A) {};

{\it \textbf{John~Wiseheart}}
\end{center}

DevSpace is truly awesome, so naturally it's run by a truly awesome
person; John Wiseheart who's currently hiding out in the Blue Mountains 
 (!) due to crimes against Arduinos (!!). Hopefully he'll escape charges 
and get given a space to dev in.

TalkShops Heads
---------------

\begin{center}
\tikz\node[circle,inner sep=.125\linewidth,fill overzoom image=images/adam.jpg] (A) {};
\tikz\node[circle,inner sep=.125\linewidth,fill overzoom image=images/daniel.jpg] (A) {};

{\it \textbf{Adam~Tizzone} \\
  \& \textbf{Daniel~Phillips}}
\end{center}

TalkShops is no longer TalkShops, but Talks and (Work)Shops! What a 
surprise for the start of the year.

Adam and Daniel are the minds behind this year's talks and
workshops that fill the CSESoc calendar, bringing the brightest minds
and sharpest people to \CSE---usually _back_ to \CSE.  And with a
goals list that contains "_hev fun_" twice, and some fantastic events
planned already, it's well worthwhile keeping tabs on the calendar.


Student Network Head
--------------------

\begin{center}
\tikz\node[circle,inner sep=.125\linewidth,fill overzoom image=images/jesse.jpg] (A) {};

{\it \textbf{Jesse~Zhang}}
\end{center}

Ever the party animal (and a "magical, magical horse"), Jesse
is our StuNet head this year, although
most of the time he's trying to make it through airport security with 
hundreds of USBs in his pockets.
