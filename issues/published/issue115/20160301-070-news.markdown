__This Apple Is Cursed: FBI.__
Over the summer, we've been following the unfolding disaster of
legalese and personal privacy that is the court battle between Apple
and the United States FBI over backdooring cryptographic protections
in iOS.  A huge number of parties have come out in support for, and
against, the FBI's proposed measures; we'll have more a comprehensive
wrap-up in coming weeks.

__Facebook Reactions: "Humanity in Six Emotions."__
The ever-ubiquitous "Like", a long-time byword for the world's single
largest active social network, got an overhaul; now, instead of just a
singular like, you can have one of a (carefully curated) range of
emotions.  This should, they hope, keep contentless comments to a
minimum.  You may enjoy the "Ironic" button below this item.

__Accelerated Mobile Pages comes to Google, WordPress.__
The search giant is now flagging content using the AMP spec as being
"mobile-friendly", and with 25% of content powered by the blog
engine/remote code execution vulnerability, this puts the push on a
leaner Web going forward.  Who knew that stripping a gigabyte of
miscellaneous JavaScript improved performance?

__Edgy sequel to 'Blade Runner' confirmed.__
Finally, it's been confirmed: Ridley Scott has assembled a sequel, to be
written by Hampton Fancher, directed by Denis Villeneuve, and starring Harrison
Ford and... Ryan Gosling? The masterwork's successor will be released on 12
January, 2018 in North America.

__New flagships from Samsung and LG.__
Traces of innovation have been found in the Galaxy S7 and LG G5, with
sharper displays, more cameras, water resistance, snappier processors,
and fatter memory and storage, it's looking like 2016 is the year to
watch in the smartphone arena.

__Huge SSDs hitting the shelves.__
Samsung is also touting a 15.36 TB drive at the forefront of its new
high-capacity enterprise SSD range, the PM1633a series; they claim it'll
clock 1.2 GB/s sequential read and 200 kIOPS of random read. and will
handle a full drive write per day for "several" years.  If you're in
enterprise storage, drool away; the price tag is expected to be in the
several thousand dollar range.

__SpaceX launches a rocket!__
After a week of five launch scrubs, SpaceX launched an unmanned Falcon 9,
towing a telecommunications satellite into Earth's constellation of orbiting
debris, before returning, though sadly not landing, to the sea.

__2016, now in beta.__
No use beta-ing a dead horse: Emily Olorin has taken over CSE's favourite
magazine, and is turning it to all kinds of evil and hopefully minimally
tentacled deeds.
