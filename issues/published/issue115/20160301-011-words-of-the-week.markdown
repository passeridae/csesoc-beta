Words of the Week
=================

\multicols{2}

Every week, we bring you the latest and greatest in Jargon, be it obscure or
otherwise. Where does this Jargon come from, you ask? Why, the Jargon Files
of course, the internet's favourite place for all things *hacker*. Have fun!
These weeks words are:

**playpen**: [IBM] A room where programmers work. Compare salt mines.

**go root**: [Unix; common] To temporarily enter root mode in order to perform a privileged operation. This use is deprecated in Australia, where v. ‘root’ is a synonym for “f\*ck”.

**lose lose**: A reply to or comment on an undesirable situation. “I accidentally deleted all my files!” “Lose, lose.”
