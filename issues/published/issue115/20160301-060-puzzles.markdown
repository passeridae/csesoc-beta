Brain Teasers
-------------

A.
:   Five CSE students are eating lunch together after an exhausting
    COMP4121 lecture, all following their usual routine of alternating
    between thinking about algorithms and eating delicious noodles,
    individually switching between activities whenever the mood strikes
    them. They're sitting in a circle in the quad setting out their food
    when they realise that they have a problem: they've only been given five
    chopsticks between them.

    Being CSE students, they're both averse to unnecessary exertion and
    very fair-minded, so it is decided that each student will receive one
    chopstick, which they each lay down to their left side. None of them
    want to embarass themselves by attempting to eat with only one
    chopstick, but they all know each other fairly well and so will
    happily take turns sharing the chopsticks.

    Is there a procedure or set of rules which, if adopted by all of the
    students, will make sure that none of them starve regardless of how
    long they remain there? (You may assume that the students have
    infinite appetite and infinite noodles.)
