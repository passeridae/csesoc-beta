Winter Watching
===============

\multicols{2}

Winter, as I suspect you know, is cold, and it's looking to be a damn
cold winter this winter. So what best to help keep you warm on a cold,
blustery day, than staying nice and warm in bed, watching YouTube
videos and ignoring parents?

To facilitate maximum levels of staying-in-bed and telling your
parents that you are, in fact, doing uni-related "work", I present
here a list of must-watch videos ranging from dawn-of-the-internet
speculative pieces, to documentaries showing current-day reality. Feel
free to skip the ones that don't catch your interest, there's lots
more to see, and many more winters to come. Happy watching!

1. _Citizenfour_

    A very pertinent documentary in light of recent Australian and
    international laws, we---through the lens of Laura
    Poitras---follow Edward Snowden as he releases to the world the
    extent of the spying going on behind our backs.  Filmed live, as
    proceedings were ongoing, it makes for a compelling watch, if only
    to watch how genuinely Snowden responds to what is happening
    around (and because of) him.  "We are building the biggest weapon
    for oppression in the history of mankind."

2. _The Internet's Own Boy_

    This documentary, unlike all the others listed, is about a person
    rather than a movement or an idea.  Developer of RSS, and
    co-founder of Reddit, Aaron Swartz's foray into politics led to a
    massive legal struggle which culminated in him taking his own life
    two years ago.  Framed against a backdrop of ever increasing
    control on internet rights, as well as civil liberties, it's a
    powerful piece of media, and a very recommended watch.

3. _Revolution OS_

    A documentary looking at the people, and their rationales, backing
    the open source movement.  With such interviewees as
    Richard Stallman and Linus Torvalds, and covering over 20 years,
    it's an interesting watch.  Bonus points because of the animosity
    between people in the movement---Linus and Richard, I'm looking at
    you. As Linus said, "Think of Richard Stallman as the great
    philosopher and think of me as the engineer."  Because credit is
    meant to be shared.  (Those interested in computing culture, here's
    where a lot of it began.)

4. _The DEFCON Documentary_

    UNSW sends teams off to the DEFCON CTF (Capture the Flag) to fight
    for victory almost every year.  In terms of the SecEng world,
    DEFCON is a realm unto itself.  This documentary talks about the
    origins of DEFCON, as well as how things have grown into what they
    are today (plus it's pretty hilarious to boot).  If you're looking
    for lectures or a how-to-hack, this isn't your jam, but if you're
    interested in the people and culture surrounding the hackosphere,
    and what the hell goes on at DEFCON, we have you covered.

5. _Hyperland_

    Douglas Adams narrates (and stars in!) this blast to the past,
    dreaming about a future where people play a more active role in
    the information they digest (hmm, now what does that sound
    like...).  With Tom Baker as his guide, he dreams a dream about
    what we now call the Internet.  Part historical documentary, part
    exploration of (then) current knowledge, it's altogether engaging.

6. _Primer_

    Expect to watch this movie more than once.  Made on a shoestring
    budget, and not skimping on the technobabble, this is a film for a
    day you can appreciate it.  Our basic premise is time travel, but
    the direction taken is entirely unexpected.  Thoroughly
    recommended.

7. _Hackers_

    Oh Hackers, how can I describe thee.  Quintessentially 90s,
    horrifyingly inaccurate, yet strangely compelling.  This movie
    shows us the programmers we wish we could be, in the fashion we
    wish we could forget.
