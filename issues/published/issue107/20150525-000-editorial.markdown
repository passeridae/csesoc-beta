Hello, hello, and welcome to the last issue of this semester.

We have exciting security news this week, followed by more exciting
security news (wherein everything is on fire).  We've also got a great
list of films to watch over the winter break, to while away the time
in front of the server rack, and some puzzles for when MPlayer
crashes.

If you're bored during the holidays and stumble upon anything
interesting, or you're keen to get involved, join the team via the
CSESoc website, or send in an article---`beta@cse.unsw.edu.au`.  We'd
love to hear from you, and hey, your article will very likely end up
in print.

It's another rather sparse week, and we're looking forward to kicking
off next semester with a decent amount of content!

Have a great holiday, and we'll see you back next semester.
