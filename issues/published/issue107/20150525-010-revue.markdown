CSE Revue Camp 2015
===================

\multicols{2}

It's the middle of the year and a cool thing to do is to revue some
life choices so why not do that at CSE revue camp!

CSE Revue will be heading up the coast for the time of our
lives! In the tradition of a themed revue, theme this year is
\textsc{main characters} (main characters?! what is this even) Come as
a main character from any TV shows, anime, movies, or
games---\textsc{no} side-kicks! (not really)

Expect an awesome Trivia Night (Friday), and a Dance Party (Saturday)!
Trivia will be full of quizzical questions with tie-breaking bonus
rounds and awesome prizes! Dance party has dancing in it! and a party
too! Costumes would be worn for the event, so bring your own and
expect to a night to remember.

_Psst_... the theme will then be revealed.

So, If you're new to the notion of revue and want to witness the
glamour of revue, come to camp! Camp's a great opportunity for people
who's undecided in Revue! Vocal blocks! Dance blocks! Other great
activities! It's a perfect mix of excitement and relaxation, with
board games, late sleeping on the side and is great taste of what CSE
Revue has to offer.

Meet and familiar yourself with Exec and Orgs heads and spend a
weekend with people who will be contributing to show this year.
