It's been more than two weeks since the last column; it's been almost
four.  Jashank is a freewheeling and careless publisher.  It's not my
fault.  Anyway, here's a vaguely security-themed TL;DR: every system
you rely on is on fire.

__Logjam TLS attack.__
The implementation of Diffie-Hellman key exchange in common
\textsc{ssl/tls} suites is vulnerable to an interception attack,
Logjam, that negotiates a downgrade to 1990s export-grade
ciphersuites. Once downgraded, the connection can be fully decrypted
if you have a huge budget for solving discrete logarithms
quickly. State actors may have been enjoying this technique for quite
some time. Cryptographer Matthew Green estimates it will take "a few
dozen person-lifetimes" to mitigate, being as much a social problem as
a technical one.

__VENOM vulnerability.__

CVE-2015-3456 (\textsc{venom}) concerns a rather terrible bug in
QEMU's floppy disk controller (\textsc{fdc}), loaded in all versions
of Xen prior to 4.6, with or without an attached floppy device. The
flaw has been present since 2004, and also affects \textsc{kvm}.
\textsc{venom} allows direct code execution on the host from an
unprivileged virtual machine, affecting services like Amazon EC2,
Linode, and DigitalOcean. Patches have been released.

__Buffer overrun wreaks havoc.__
A stack buffer overrun in a proprietary kernel module, NetUSB, has
rendered millions of consumer-grade routers extremely vulnerable. The
module, developed by KCodes, is supposed to provide USB over IP port
20005, and is typically used for sharing printers or hard
drives. According to SEC Consult, a remote attacker could very easily
gain direct access to kernel memory.

__Police fear encryption.__
Encryption and digital currencies give law enforcement the fear. The
National Organised Crime Response Plan, eked out this week between
federal and state Attorneys-General and police ministers, singles out
consumer-grade privacy technology as “enablers of crime”. This country
is run by brutal, ignorant garbage-people.

__Eager security star gets bucks, abuse.__
Sakurity researcher and infosec celebrity Egor Homakov has raised the
hackles of Starbucks, American purveyor of WiFi and bad beanwater.
Homakov exploited a race condition in balance transfer code for
Starbucks Gift Cards, permitting double spend. He stole $1.70 and was
casually accused of fraud, despite the responsible disclosure. Take
COMP3151 to avoid embarrassing yourself this way in public.

__Stunt hacker dun goofs.__
Researcher Chris Roberts has caused media hysteria after pentesting a
passenger aircraft during flight. Passenger entertainment resides on
the same network segment as actual flight systems, many of which use
default passwords. Roberts bizarrely told an FBI officer he had
accessed real-time flight systems, getting into the news on every
continent and sending public perception of security research back to
the Kevin Mitnick era.

__iOS 9 will support old devices.__
New iOS releases are usually exercises in forced obsolescence, making
sure nobody keeps an Apple phone for more than three years.  That
cynical truth is set to be invalidated by the upcoming iOS 9, with the
core OS developed for the older devices, and new features tacked on
for more recent devices once it performs well.  Additionally, the Swift
ABI will soon be frozen, reducing app sizes by quite a bit.  This seems
bad for business, so I'll believe it when I see it run on my 4S.

__Wild and crazy IRC channel appears.__
IRC may not have changed since 1992, but neither have any of the tools
or techniques we learn in Computer Science. CSEsoc IRC is back, and
it's going crazy. Join `##cse` on Freenode!
