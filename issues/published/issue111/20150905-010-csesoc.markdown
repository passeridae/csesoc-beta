Imagine a thriving community where you can build life-long friendships
with people who are passionate about computing, engage in fun social
events, network with sponsor companies, explore your interests and
help encourage the next generation of computing!

The UNSW Computer Science and Engineering Society (CSESoc) is the
principal representative body for computing students on campus and has
been running for almost a decade. CSESoc caters to over 2100
undergraduate and postgraduate computing students studying Computer
Science, Software Engineering, Bioinformatics and Computer
Engineering.

We have various sub-teams that aim to make your experience as a university student awesome (and you can also be part of these teams too)!

Social
:    Social events are held almost every week and are a great chance to
     meet other students and most importantly have fun. Events include
     our free weekly BBQs, trivia, off campus events and First Year
     Camp.

Student Network
:    Joining university is a big step, and the CSE Student Network
     fosters a welcoming community for new students as you are
     assigned an older student mentor to guide you through the
     transition from high school to UNSW. We open up applications a
     few months before your first semester.

Devspace
:    Love playing with new technology or always wanted to try out a
     new gadget you've heard about? Devspace is the hub for getting
     hands-on access to equipment such as 3D printers, Oculus Rift,
     Arduino and more. It's also a space for developing student
     software projects and building cool stuff.

Sponsors
:    Getting a good start to your career is within arms reach. We have
     numerous big-name sponsors to allow you to network professionally
     and find out what opportunities are out there. Tech talks and
     Sponsor events are in motion regularly and many of our members
     end up working for these companies.

CompClub
:    If you're passionate about encouraging the next generation of
     computing then we recommend volunteering for CompClub. It was
     established by CSESoc as an initiative to help high school
     students explore the depth and breadth of Computer Science. We
     reach over 300 schools within the Sydney region alone. From
     competitions to computer games, the Computing Club aims to spark
     the interest of students who are just starting their journey with
     computing.

Dev, Publicity, Beta
:    We also have the Dev team which holds hackathons and keeps the dev
     side of our society running, the Publicity team which is
     responsible for hip merchandise to flaunt your CSESoc pride and
     the Beta team who publish articles such as the one you're reading
     now.

CSESoc wishes you all the best for the future!
