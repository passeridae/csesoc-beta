The Security Society of UNSW
============================

The Security Society of UNSW is a newly-formed group of students who
are passionate about computer security. Our plan is to run lots of
exciting workshops around security, covering all sorts of awesome
security/hacking content; as well as running our own competitions, and
competing in, and winning, national and international CTFs.

Last year we took out the top 3 places in CySCA, a Telstra/DoD-run
competition for Australian uni students. We also sent a team to
DEFCON, effectively the biggest, hardest, and most important CTF,
where we placed ninth in the world. So if this sounds like something
you might be interested in, definitely come and say hi.

Robogals UNSW
=============

Robogals runs engineering-related workshops for high-school students,
covering an ever-expanding variety of topics ranging from programming
in Python to robotics with \textsc{lego} Mindstorms.

Robogals is passionate about promoting engineering to young women,
especially because of the gender gap that currently exists.  It's a
great cause, it's fun, and you'll get to meet lots of people both
within and outside your degree.
