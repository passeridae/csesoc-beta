The News

__Wizards of the Coast brings _Magic_ and _D&D_ together.__
Wizards of the Coast have released _Plane Shift: Zendikar_, which
allows one of the realms of _Magic: The Gathering_ to become a fifth
edition _Dungeons & Dragons_ stomping ground.

__LHC downed by... weasel?__
The Large Hadron Collider has shut down due to a beech marten chewing
through wiring in a high voltage transformer, cutting power to
refrigeration that keeps part of the 27 km particle physics toroid a
few degrees above absolute zero.  The incident occurred days after the
LHC resumed scientific activities for 2016.  It's expected that
physics will resume again in May following repairs.

The news comes on the back of CERN's publication of 300 TB of particle
physics data from the LHC, in raw and "derived" forms, corresponding
to around half the experiments run by one detector in 2011, which
followed the release of 17 TB of data produced in 2010.

__NIST prepares Post-Quantum Crypto Competition.__
The US National Institute of Standards and Technology have announced
plans for a competition to create quantum-resistant encryption, noting
that a functional quantum computer renders nearly all current broadly
deployed cryptographic systems.  The competition will run similarly to
the SHA-3 Competition, and it's expected that the result will be
multiple cryptographic systems.

__Phones don't cause cancer!__
A major USyd study has shown there's no concrete increase in brain
cancers over the last 29 years, even despite our massive use of mobile
phones; correlations in increases are attributed to better diagnostic
techniques.

__Loon crash.__
Google's Project Loon, which aims to provide Internet connectivity to
the world through a network of high-altitude balloons, had an
otherwise-successful flight end with a crash-landing in a field in
Chile.

__Backblaze releases Storage Pod v6.__
If you ever felt the urge to store 480 TB of data, backup company
Backblaze has made it easy for you, with a new sixty-drive version of
their monster storage system design.  But be warned: fully populating
one of these puppies will set you back ten to twenty thousand USD.
Ouch.

__Mozilla pushing Thunderbird out of the nest?__
The Mozilla Foundation are looking to divest the Thunderbird mail
client, with the Software Freedom Conservancy (home to Git, Inkscape
and QEMU), and The Document Foundation (home of LibreOffice), as well
as The GNOME Foundation and Software in the Public Interest (home of
Debian), all tipped as potential new, ahem, dovecotes.

__YouTube launching 6-second ads.__
You may have to wait just a second more, as YouTube prepares to launch
an unskippable 6-second "bumper" ad format, a drop from the current
15-second minimum ad length.
