9 May
:    Optiver BBQ and Tech Talk\hfill\bcalSocial{} 

     _12:30--4pm, John Lions Garden K17_

    Optiver is a leading global market maker. We trade on the financial markets
    using our own capital and at our own risk. While Trading is our core business at
    Optiver, this is not possible without our team of IT experts. Their goal is to
    build and release the platforms that we trade on. We aim to run the fastest and
    most reliable systems in the market, systems that are also flexible enough to
    respond quickly to change. Come and hear more about what we do and where you
    could fit in! We're on the hunt for passionate final year students to join our
    team as a Graduate Software Developer or Graduate Trading Systems Engineer, so
    this is the perfect chance to kickstart a career with us. Former CSESoc alumni
    Will Korteland will be at the BBQ and the event to answer any of your questions
    - So feel free to come prepared!


19 May
:    Intro to Front End Web Dev Workshop\hfill\bcalTech{}
 
     _1--2pm, the Seminar Room K17_

    If you've ever been interested in web development then this is the workshop for 
    you!

    We're going to cover basic html, css and bootstrap, as well as font awesome, 
    hover.css and some other useful tools. By the end of the workshop, you will have 
    the skills and knowledge to make the front-end for almost any type of website, 
    and a responsive personal portfolio website on which to show your new creations 
    off!

    The only thing you need to bring is a laptop with a plain text editor like 
    Sublime Text if you plan on following along. We hope to see you all there!

    P.S. If you're keen to get extra prepared then check out emmet.io and add it to 
    your favourite text editor to save yourself from having to type as much html.

:    Google Anita Borg Scholarship


    Dr. Anita Borg devoted her adult life to dismantling barriers that keep women 
    and minorities from entering computing and technology fields. As part of 
    Google's ongoing commitment to furthering Anita's vision, we are pleased to 
    announce The 2016 Google Anita Borg Memorial Scholarship: Asia Pacific.

    Through the scholarship, we aim to encourage women to excel in computing and 
    technology, and become active role models and leaders. Scholarship recipients 
    from Asia Pacific who have demonstrated impressive leadership and a commitment 
    to advancing women in the field will also be invited to an all-expense-paid 
    retreat in India, at our Google Hyderabad office from August 30th to September 
    2nd 2016.

    If you're eligible - apply for the scholarship!
