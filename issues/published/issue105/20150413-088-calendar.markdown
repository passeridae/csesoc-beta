:    Vim Workshop\hfill\bcalTech{}  
    _5p, K17 Seminar Room_

    Vim is a text editor.  It can run in a terminal, over ssh or as
    it's own app.  But what's the big deal?  Well, Vim is quite
    powerful, and mastering it will allow you to program much faster.

    However to unlock Vim's power requires quite a learning curve, and
    that's where this workshop comes in!  Join CallumÂ Howard and learn
    how you can edit text at the speed of thought.
