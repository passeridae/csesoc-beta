First, a pr√©cis: I got made an offer to take a year off uni and write
code.  I compromised, and I'm taking a year doing full-time work and
part-time uni, which means I still get to bring you Beta each week.
But I also have some fun stories to share, so each issue, I hope to
bring you a few of them.

I suppose I should begin by saying that the company I work for is
essentially a start-up in terms of the number of employees we have.
On a good day, we have twelve people in a large open-plan office, and
while we don't have Google-grade employee perks, it's a pretty great
atmosphere, and I can really understand why the start-up culture is so
attractive.

We also seem to have a huge number of students of, and graduates from,
\UNSW\ Engineering---I suppose that's a quality thing---and some who
have even, over the course of their degrees, done first-year computing
courses.

But for the most part, my job had, up to now, been spent massaging a
PHP monolith.  It has severe performance issues; we clocked it firing
off nearly 20,000 unique database queries over three or four seconds,
and decided that Something Really Must Be Done.

To attempt to improve matters, `$boss` suggested we go and, uh, "buy
more processor".  I suggested, of course, that we go into the
butt---er, cloud---and seek what performance benefits we could get
from there.

So there I was, whacking bugs on the AWS instance, holding my laptop
in one hand, typing with the other, and walking along a major road to
work.  Truly, a great sight.

Also, SSL certificates are hard to do.  I'd write a good guide, but
it'd disappear into the thronging mass of bad ones.
