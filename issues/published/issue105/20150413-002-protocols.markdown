"Intuitive" Protocols
=====================

Upon dwelling upon the core of the Internet, and the fact that its
nothing more than a very large, very distributed system, I always
begin to feel a gentle, yet unshakable, sense of sadness creep over
me; kind of like when you first realise that the world is not a fair
place and that kitten on the box may never reach its treat, or that
Keanu Reeves will almost certainly make more money than you over
arbitrary time scales.

The Internet is such a core utility in our lives, but an eternally
confusing one.  Whenever people try to "explain" the core protocols
and connections that make up distributed, weblike, systems, they
always lean towards "intuitive", "approachable" arguments.
Interestingly, no matter how they spin it, these kinds of intuitive
arguments are not intuitive.  A successful intuitive explanation must
invoke experiences that someone would have in real life, and I have
never had a real-life experience that has resembled any form of common
distributed or Internet protocol.

For example, let's suppose that I am having a nice conversation with a
friend.  If that conversation was similar to HTTP, it would go
something like:

> __Emily.__  Alex, I would like today's `xkcd`.
>
> __Alex.__  OK, here it is.
>
> __Emily.__  Alex, I would like last week's comic.
>
> __Alex.__  Yeah, it's here.
>
> __Emily.__  Alex, I want the comic with Knuth being a ninja.
>
> __Alex.__  ... Give me a moment to find it.
>
> __Emily.__ Let me tell you again that I want the `xkcd` comic with
> Knuth being a ninja.
>
> __Alex.__ ... Here.
>
> _[Hours pass.]_
>
> __Emily.__ Alex, do you have the `xkcd` comic with the ghost and the
> eternal passage of time?
>
> __Alex.__ 404 FILE NOT FOUND. GO AWAY.

And that, children, is how you lose friends forever.


What's the Gossip?
------------------

But maybe something less concrete, more conceptual, is necessary for
the real intuitive explanation experience.  Gossip protocols are
ostensibly modeled off, you guessed it, gossip, so sound as if they
can be easily explained.  So let's pretend that I'm at a party and am
meeting someone for the first time:

> __Emily.__ I announce that my name is Emily.
>
> __Oz.__ _(to Beth)_ I verify that she announced that her name is Emily.
>
> __Andy.__ _(to Beth)_ I verify that she announced that her name is Emil.
>
> __Beth.__ _(to Oz)_ I verify that she announced that her name is Emil.
>
> __Oz.__ _(to Beth)_ I verify that she announced that her name is Emily!
>
> __Beth.__ I VERIFY THAT SHE ANNOUNCES THAT HER NAME IS EMIL!
>
> __Andy.__ I VERIFY THAT SHE ANNOUNCES THAT HER NAME IS EMIL!
>
> __Oz.__ I ANNOUNCE THAT YOUR NAME IS EMIL.
>
> __Emily.__ I announce that my name is Emily!
>
> __Oz.__ _(to Andy)_ She announces that her name is Emily.
>
> __Andy.__ _(to Beth)_ She announces that her name is Emily.
>
> __Beth.__ _(to Oz)_ She announces that her name is Emily.
>
> __Emily.__ Who are you?
>
> __Oz__, __Beth__, __Andy.__ â€¦ YOU ANNOUNCE THAT YOUR NAME IS EMILY.
>
> __Emily.__ I ANNOUNCE THAT YOU ARE BORING.
>
> __Oz.__ I ANNOUNCE THAT YOU ARE BORING.
>
> __Emily.__ I announce that I am leaving.

Have I mentioned that I don't like gossip parties?


An Ottoman And A Hard Place
---------------------------

Last but not least, we have the old "favourite", known as Byzantine
Fault Tolerance.  The name itself should give it away as being an
unintuitive idea, as neither you, nor I, nor the NSA, are Byzantine
Generals, and the attack at dawn is a ruse anyway, so we can get a few
hours peace before lunch.  So, lets all suppose I am in the basement,
and want to go to lunch with a few friends.  This is what the
experience would look like if it resembled a BFT protocol:

> __Emily.__ I announce my desire to go to lunch.
>
> __Beth.__ I verify that I heard that you want to go to lunch.
>
> __Andy.__ I also verify that I heard that you want to go to lunch.
>
> __Chris.__ YOU DO NOT WANT TO GO TO LUNCH.
>
> __Emily.__ OH NO. LET ME TELL YOU AGAIN THAT I WANT TO GO TO LUNCH.
>
> __Chris.__ YOU DO NOT WANT TO GO TO LUNCH.
>
> __Beth.__ CHRIS IS FAULTY.
>
> __Chris.__ CHRIS IS NOT FAULTY.
>
> __Andy.__ I VERIFY THAT BETH SAYS THAT CHRIS IS FAULTY.
>
> __Beth.__ I VERIFY MY VERIFICATION OF MY CLAIM THAT ANDY CLAIMS THAT I KNOW CHRIS.
>
> __Emily.__ I AM SO HUNGRY.
>
> __Chris.__ YOU ARE NOT HUNGRY.
>
> __Andy.__ I DECLARE CHRIS TO BE FAULTY.
>
> __Chris.__ I DECLARE ANDY TO BE FAULTY.
>
> __Emily.__ I DECLARE EMILY TO BE SLIPPING INTO A DIABETIC COMA.
>
> __Andy.__ I have already left for lunch.


On Coherence
------------

Ultimately, we need to stop obsessing over distributed systems and how
they do or don't talk to each other.  I don't blame people for being
interested in this hideously complex, excruciatingly irrational field,
in the same limited sense that I do not blame drug addicts for wanting
to acquire and then consume cocaine.  The desire to make computers
communicate, and then make that communication fast and reliable is a
powerful one, growing with the Internet in size and scale.  However,
unfortunately, this addiction, if left unchecked, will inescapably
lead to madness and/or reports containing no less than 453 pages of
diagrams (with appendices, containing the proofs), and these reports
will _still_ be incoherent to the educated expert.

\begin{center}

\par\textit{As you can see, we removed the labels for simplicity.}
\end{center}

Even if we break the will of the machines with formal proofs, and
restrictive protocols, and cryptography, we will never be able to put
ourselves inside the computer.  And as such, we will be left helpless
and crying as the Internet explodes and the computers decide that
gossip was overrated after all.
