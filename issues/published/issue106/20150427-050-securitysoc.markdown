The Security Society of UNSW
============================

\multicols{2}

The Security Society of UNSW is a newly-formed group of students who
are passionate about computer security. Our plan is to run lots of
exciting workshops around security, covering all sorts of awesome
security/hacking content; as well as running our own competitions, and
competing in, and winning, national and international CTFs.

Last year we took out the top 3 places in CySCA, a Telstra/DoD-run
competition for Australian uni students. We also sent a team to
DEFCON, effectively the biggest, hardest, and most important CTF,
where we placed ninth in the world. So if this sounds like something
you might be interested in, definitely come and say hi.

We've already run a workshop on using a framework called Metasploit to
exploit vulnerabilities in practice servers we set up, as well as one
on lockpicking; we're planning to run another one on Thursday next
week on hacking WiFi networks.

If this sounds like fun, then come along and check us out.
