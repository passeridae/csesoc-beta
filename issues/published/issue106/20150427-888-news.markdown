__Optus doesn't see the appeal of net neutrality.__
Optus CEO Allan Lew has publicly suggested high bandwidth players such
as Netflix pay ISPs to maintain quality of service. Speaking at
industry event CommsDay, he seems to have suggested this would improve
end user experience, and not just the bottom line at Optus. Netflix
has publicly retreated from its unmetered sweetheart deal with iiNet
in the weeks since launch, claiming it went against the neutrality
ethos.

__NBN becomes a cocompany.__
NBN Co has spent an absurd sum rebranding itself as _nbn_â„¢, without
the Co.  Along with the "new" "name", the company bought itself a new
logo that vaguely resembles its modus operandi---a large fibre dot
that quickly trickles down into tiny dial-up dots the further you get
from a wealthy urban centre. For some reason, the fibre dot is located
at Pine Gap.

__Google, Facebook earthquake relief.__
Both Google and Facebook have rolled out their disaster relief
programs to improve the response to a magnitude 6.7 earthquake in
Nepal. Google Person Finder maintains a separate database allowing one
to request or provide information about a missing person, used by
those on the ground. Facebook's Safety Check allows those in the
affected area to broadcast a sign of life to their Facebook
friends. Facebook users received a list of their contacts in the area
shortly after the incident.

__`wpa_supplicant` vulnerability.__
Vulnerability CVE-2015-1863, discovered by Alibaba, affects popular
WPA2 implementation wpa_supplicant. In peer-to-peer mode, the code
responsible for parsing the management frame's SSID field was not
correctly verifying payload length, leading to a possible 223-byte
buffer overflow. Patches are available and will be included in version
2.5.

__iOS SSL certificate parser vuln.__
Security researchers Skycure have demonstrated a bug in the iOS SSL
certificate parser at the RSA conference, though details will not be
released until Apple releases a fix. The attack causes iOS apps to
crash, and repeated attacks eventually knock over the OS itself,
bricking the device while it is in range of their malicious Wi-Fi
network.

__API flaw creates 25,000 vulns.__
SourceDNA researchers have noticed an API flaw in Apple's
`AFNetworking` framework that has led to the publication of 25,000
vulnerable apps. The TLS implementation does not check domain names
when validating certificates unless it is told to---behaviour that
developers clearly did not expect.  Any valid SSL certificate could
thus be used to masquerade as the intended host.  Versions 2.5.3 and
above contain a fix.

__New ARM core.__
ARM have announced their latest CPU. The Cortex A72 features speed,
efficiency and size improvements that render it comparable to Intel's
Broadwell line when power supply is constrained. ARM also touted the
A72's improved branch prediction, and an overall
instructions-per-clock increase over predecessor A57 of 20%-60%.

__Pebble vengeance.__
In the days after the release of the Watch, Apple had been selectively
rejecting apps that mention support for rival Pebble in their
description. It is now claimed to have been a mistake at the App Store
reviewer level, though it disrupted multiple app publishers first.
