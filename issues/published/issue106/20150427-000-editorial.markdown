Editorial
=========

Hello, hello, and welcome to this edition of \csesocbeta.

You may have noticed a bit of a gap in the chronology.  Our last
scheduled issue, two weeks ago, didn't have enough content to go to
print, and we couldn't scavenge enough up in time.

Thankfully, we don't have a single, full-page pun, telling you that we
need content in this issue.  Thankfully.  Even so, we really, really
do: it's been an awfully light week, and much of the content you see
here was stitched together in a great hurry.

It's actually surprisingly difficult to fill an issue, and we rely on
the work of many.

As ever, if you've stumbled on anything interesting, or you're keen to
get involved, join the team via the CSESoc website, or send in an
article---`beta@cse.unsw.edu.au`.  We'd love to hear from you!

We hope you enjoy this issue, and I hope to see many of you at the
Emacs workshop!
