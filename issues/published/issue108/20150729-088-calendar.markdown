Welcome to Unswot
=================

In the rapidly innovating IT world, fast-moving startups are cropping
up in abundance. Unswot is a \UNSW-based startup which seeks to bring
back intellectual chats over coffee, but with a modern technological
twist.

Unswot aims to bring the human element back into conversation,
reversing the conventional lecture, tutorial or seminar.  It's a
platform for academics to discover, host, and participate in informal,
face-to-face discussions---'Unswots'---designed to promote discourse
on a spectrum of creative, unconventional and thought-provoking
topics.  Pilot topics have ranged from the Rwandan genocide, to
anti-piracy laws and the international community; hosts simply post
their topic of interest on the Unswot website, and can connect with
people of similar interests, whilst enjoying free coffee at various
on-campus cafes.

With this promising new startup hot on our hands, the Unswot team have
curated some of the most engaging tech Unswots for the next fortnight.
Join the conversation at `unswot.com`!
