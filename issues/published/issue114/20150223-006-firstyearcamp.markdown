The Road to Your Future
=======================

Let's face it.

Coming into University is difficult. You have to use your brain to get
good marks, and use your feet to get up the Main Walkway.  It's a time
of procrastination, spurred on by new friends and new experiences.
But let's leave that difficulty behind---if only for one dreamy
weekend.

The Computer Science and Engineering Society (CSESoc) wants to take
you---yes, you!---away to a magical remote tropical island for a
weekend, to relax, drink from coconuts and meet fellow students.  Come
with us to a paradise filled with new friends, loads of fun and games
as well as more activities than you can poke a (bamboo) stick at.

Trivia nights, dance parties, scavenger hunts and more fun await you
at our tropical sojourn.  You'll be relaxed and in touch with your
inner self in no time at all.

Following your trip, you'll return to uni calm and relaxed, with
plenty of new friends to help you keep the good vibes going during the
year and the rest of your time at \UNSW. It's a once in a lifetime
experience you don't want to miss out on.

We're looking forward to seeing you at our tropical paradise...
