Hello, hello, and welcome to another week's Beta.

Moving up in the team this week is the multi-talented \TeX nician,
Emily Saunders Walmsley, who has braved the horrors within the
\csesocbeta\ build and styles, and survived.  This bodes poorly for
the future of my job.

And finally shamed into contributing is Tim Humphries, who is
demonstrating by example that you don't even have to be in the country
to write for us.

As ever, if you've stumbled on anything interesting, or you're keen to
get involved, join the team via the CSESoc website.

Enjoy!

Stureps are currently running this session's survey for the CSE
faculty, and for all CSE courses.  This is your chance to have a say in
how CSE is going, or how your courses are running.  The feedback goes
into creating a report which we discuss with the head of school, and
from that we look to improve anything that needs to be improved.

There are two surveys: a faculty survey, and a per-course survey.
Head to the survey links on the CSESoc Facebook group to fill them out.
