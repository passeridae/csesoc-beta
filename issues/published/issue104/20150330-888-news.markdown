The News

\multicols{2}

Metadata State
:    Customer metadata will be stored for at least two years by
     Australia's telcos and ISPs, after the Government's data
     retention laws made it through the Senate with full Labor
     support.  Amendments requiring the destruction of data after two
     years failed to carry.  The scheme kicks off in 18 months, and
     provides little protection for journalists and whistle-blowers.

The Rentiers Advance
:    The Federal Government has introduced a bill allowing
     rights-holders to block websites that facilitate copyright
     infringement.  A single successful application could block any
     number of sites, with a best-effort attempt to notify the site
     administrators.  CSE students will find the blocks trivila to
     bypass, and few will be surprised to see this Government side
     with foreign rentiers over the policy.

TLS Vulnerability
:    Two attacks targeting the RC4 stream cipher, part of TLS, have
     been published.  RC4 encrypts about one-third of the Internet's
     TLS traffic.  While the attacks are unfeasible for ordinary
     attackers, users and TLS implementers are urged to disable RC4.

Slack Hack
:    Slack, a colourful and browserified workplace IRC service, has
	 reported a significant breach.  The company believes no financial
	 information, nor any conversations, were accessed, though a
	 database of login credentials, Skype names, and hashed passwords
	 should be considered fully compromised.  The firm recommends
	 two-factor authentication, and changing your passwords.

Github DDoS
:    Github has been under DDoS attack for days, after China's Great
     Firewall injected JavaScript into the browsers of Baidu users.
     The script instructs browsers to connect to two subversive Github
     projects, CN-NYTimes and Greatfire, every two seconds.  Github is
     still generally available.

Technicalities
:    A San Francisco court has thrown out claims of gender
     discrimination brought by Reddit CEO Ellen Pao against her former
     venture capital employers, Kleiner-Perkins.  Despite the verdict,
     few would consider this a win for the company, as Pao and her
     lawyers detailed a series of disgraceful internal practices.

Safari Users Free to Sue GOOG
:    Safari users in the UK are free to sue Google over tracking
     cookies.  Apple's browser can reject cookies for passive visits,
     accepting only when the user interacts with the page.  Google had
     faked a form submission on every Safari hit to bypass the
     feature.  The Court of Appeal of England and Wales ruled the
     matter was within the jurisdiction of the British courts.

SSD Density on the Rise
:    Intel and Micron have announced new manufacturing techniques that
     will triple \textsc{nand} density.  3D \textsc{nand} involves
     stacking flash cells vertically in 32 layers, permitting SSDs
     with up to 10 TB capacity in the current 2.5" form factor.

Hotel Wi-Fi Very, Very Bad
:    Security researches Cylance have filed CVE-2015-0932, identifying
     an unsecured `rsync(1)` daemon running on the AntLabs InnGate
     wireless gateway.  This device is extremely common at hotels and
     convention centres, and the vulnerability permits remote code
     execution.  Port 873, for the curious.  Travelling without a VPN
     remains a remarkably bad idea.

Windows Update Strikes
:    Windosw Update has conspired to relegate a second-division pro
     basketball team in Germany.  A laptop intended to control the
     scoreboard delayed a Paderborn Baskets home game by updating
     without prompt for 17 minutes, inviting league penalties, and
     inspiring the world to connect all of their household appliances
     to the Internet.
