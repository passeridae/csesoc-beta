Ahh, coffee. More commonly known as the lifeblood that fuels the dreams of champions, it’s no surprise that it’s the most popular beverage to buy around uni. But have you been ordering coffee wrong your whole life? Chances are you haven’t, but just in case you should read this anyway.

__Don’t ask for ‘the usual’__

Yes, you remember your own coffee order. That’s great, you but you only have one. Baristas deal with hundreds of people every day, and you’re not as special as you think. If you must insist on ordering "the usual", don’t get angry when someone has to clarify what "the usual" is. And make sure you know what "the usual" is. Yes, that’s right. You’d really be surprised how many people order coffee for themselves or for their significant others AND DON’T ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE but goshdarnit they’ll still know if it’s wrong.

You should also never say to the cashier that "the barista knows what I get". The barista isn’t taking your order.

There is only one situation where it’s acceptable to ask for "the usual", and that’s when the person taking your order has previously acknowledged that they remember your order.

__If it’s not normal, say so__

If you ask for a small latte, you’ll get a latte made in a small takeaway cup with a small shot of coffee and full-cream milk with no sugars, made at about 65°C. If you actually wanted an extra-hot small skim double-shot latte with caramel and 3 sugars to have here, you need to say that. 

"But last time I got it-"

__Don’t ask for a cappuccino with no chocolate and no foam__


A lot of people don’t know that there’s very little difference between coffees, particularly cappuccinos, lattes and flat whites. Here’s a handy infographic that I stole from pinterest:

See how every one of those has the same size espresso shot? That’s because they all have the same size espresso shot. Lattes aren’t weaker and “more milkly” than flat whites. Espressos aren’t super hardcore caffeine potions. A cappuccino with no chocolate and no foam is just a flat white. Chances are if you try and order one you’ll either get a condescending smile or an argument with the barista.

There’s only a few potential discrepancies: Cappuccinos may have more foam than lattes, mochas may have foam, and espressos and long blacks may have 1.5 times the espresso.

__Don’t combine coffee names__

There’s no such thing as a mocha latte, or a vienna macchiato, or a white short black. Don’t make things up to sound smart. If you want a combination of two things, ask for a mocha with foam, or a macchiato with whipped cream, or a short black with a dash of milk. Don’t make the cashier or the barista figure out what the heck you actually want.

__Don’t be vague__

“I’ll have a coffee”

“What kind of coffee?”

“One with milk”

“Cappuccino, latte or flat white?”

“Whichever one has milk”

There’s a menu. Pick an item from the menu and ask for it. If you don’t know what they mean, look it up. We live in the age of the internet.

Congratulations to everyone that has never done any of the things listed above. You make up 95% of the nice people that order coffee. For the 5% that annoy cashiers and baristas, at least you’re now aware of what you do. Live and learn (and drink coffee)!
