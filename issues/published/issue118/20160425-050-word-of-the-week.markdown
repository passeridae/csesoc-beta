Words of the Week
=================

\multicols{2}

Every week, we bring you the latest and greatest in Jargon, be it obscure or otherwise. Where does this Jargon come from, you ask? Why, the Jargon Files of course, the internet's favourite place for all things *hacker*. Have fun! These weeks words are:


**iron box**: [Unix/Internet] A special environment set up to trap a cracker logging in over remote connections long enough to be traced. May include a modified shell restricting the cracker's movements in unobvious ways, and ‘bait’ files designed to keep him interested and logged on. See also back door, firewall machine, Venus flytrap, and Clifford Stoll's account in The Cuckoo's Egg of how he made and used one. Compare padded cell, honey pot.

**lint**: [from Unix's lint(1), named for the bits of fluff it supposedly picks from programs]

1. vt. To examine a program closely for style, language usage, and portability problems, esp. if in C, esp. if via use of automated analysis tools, most esp. if the Unix utility lint(1) is used. This term used to be restricted to use of lint(1) itself, but (judging by references on Usenet) it has become a shorthand for any exhaustive review process at some non-Unix shops, even in languages other than C. Also as v. delint. 
2. n. Excess verbiage in a document, as in “This draft has too much lint”.

**fish**: [Adelaide University, Australia]: A metasyntactic variable. See foo. Derived originally from the Monty Python skit in the middle of The Meaning of Life entitled Find the Fish.
