Brainteasers
------------

A.
:   Emily and Sharif are in class, passing highly confidential notes to each other 
    (about what to have for dinner that night). They suspect that the people passing 
    the notes are snooping, so want to stop them from looking at their plans.

    Each of them has their own key and matching lock, and Emily has a wooden box she 
    plans on locking. Neither key can be used on the other lock. Using the box, how 
    can the two successfully pass notes without anyone else seeing them?

B.
:   Show that in a simple graph with at least two vertices there must be two 
    vertices that have the same degree.

A.
:    This is a variation on the Hat puzzle; the winner announced "Blue".
     Note: This puzzle was Officially Buckland Approved (TM)!

B.
:    In a family with two chldren, there are four possibilities: bb, bg, gb, gg. 
     Since we are given that at least one child is a girl there are three 
     possibilities in our sample set: bg, gb, or gg. Out of those three, the only 
     one with two girls is gg. Hence the probability is 1/3.
