__rms to Canonical: Linux + ZFS = No!__
Canonical is making moves to add support for formerly-Sun's
fantastic volume manager and file system, ZFS, to Ubuntu 16.04, a move
that's raised the ire of the Free Software Conservancy _and_
Richard Stallman because of licensing concerns related to ZFS' Common
Development and Distribution License, regarded as GPL-incompatible.
Apple previously introduced, then quietly scrapped, ZFS support for
OS X, and it's speculated that the same license restrictions
caused problems in the Cupertino camp.

__EU Antitrust to Google: No!__
Android is facing the same antitrust problems that Microsoft saw in
the late 1990's, with the European Commission alleging that users are
forcibly shepherded towards exclusively using Google's platform and
products.  Android runs on over 80% of European handsets, and Google
could face fines of up to 10% of their global annual revenue,
approximately US$74.5bn.

__NASA 'turns it off and on again', saves deep space probe.__
The Kepler deep-space observatory, now on its second scientific
mission searching for exoplanets, suffered a failure that sent it
into its Emergency Mode.  The exact cause is still unknown, but is
suspected to be a transient freak-out, and restarting onboard
computers "appears to have cleared the problem."  Engineering!

__Tesla Model X recall.__
Tesla Motors has had yet another voluntary recall, with nearly three
thousand Model X vehicles pulled for third-row seats that could fold
forward during a crash.  Tesla has rapidly shifted the blame onto the
third-party supplier that manufactures those seats, and that supplier
is replacing affected components.  ...but when your seats are fixed,
you can try to unlock a Mario Kart-esque Rainbow Road!

__Chrome 50: Goodbye, Windows XP!__
Google Chrome 50 no longer supports Windows XP and Vista, and OS X
10.6 through 10.8.  Windows XP still commands 10% of the market,
seventeen years after its launch and two years after Microsoft killed
it, and is still deployed in enterprise, embedded, and military
environments.

__Android accessibility awakening, better hands-free.__
Google is improving access to the Android and Chrome OS platforms with
speech recognition: in the near future, you can get the Voice Access
on the Google Play Store, with neat prompts to help users with limited
mobility get around the touch-first OS.

__Facebook: bots!__
Facebook is pushing bots into the Messenger platform, likely inspired
by the raft of developer collaboration tools with powerful and
friendly bots, and moves by Microsoft to do the same with Skype.

In the high-speed round-up: __Lytro__ have produced a 755 megapixel,
300 fps behemoth of a cinematic camera, which will make producing
CGI/live action hybrid footage easier---green-screen sans green.
Microsoft is shipping a tiny version of __Outlook__ for your Android
Wear device!  Tasmania's __Basslink__ power and telecoms interconnect
to be repaired by June, with the forthcoming replacement of nearly 90
tonnes of undersea cable over 240 metres.  Google update the logo for
the __Play Music__ streaming audio platform, with a stylised pizza
slice, and brings podcasts.  Apple refresh the new single-port
__MacBook__, souping up its processor (the first Apple to land with an
Intel Skylake-class processor) and memory.  Western Digital lands a
new line of monster-sized SSDs, the __WD Gold__, targeted at
high-capacity datacentre applications, in 4, 6, and 8 TB variants.
__Remix OS__ landed its support for the Google Nexus 9 and 10 tablets,
giving them windows, and a more conventional desktop paradigm with a
browseable file system, to give a result resembling a Surface.  The
world's __tiniest__ open-source Arduino: a ATtiny328 in the same form
factor as a AA battery!  ___Mr. Robot___ is back, with season 2
kicking off on July 13; and ___Blade Runner___ has moved up its
schedule to land in October 2017.
