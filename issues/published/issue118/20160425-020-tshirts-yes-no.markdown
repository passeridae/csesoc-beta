The Trouble With T-shirts
=========================

\multicols{2}

Do you spend your time thinking about t-shirts? Do you enjoy t-shirts? Are you surprised by t-shirts? Are you enraged by t-shirts? Do you feel a bounty of love and appreciation for your fellow human beings traveling through this confusing and finite lifetime with you through t-shirts? That would be weird.

Two of our very own CSE members are at least some of the above, and have spent time musing on the topic of t-shirts, and their roles in our lives. What are your thoughts?

Oh man, I love t-shirts
-----------------------

Have you ever noticed, walking around the basement, that there are t-shirt themes from time to time? And have you noticed that everyone seems super pleased that they're one of the matching ones? There’s a reason for this, and that reason is cohesion. 

In comp, t-shirts play a similar role to suits in the corporate world; they allow everyone to feel a part of something larger than themselves, an elite “family”. Heading into tech, one of the first things I did was to attend a series of events and grab t-shirts at every opportunity I could (yeah, I know, I had my priorities straight). It made a real impact on how I saw myself (I was one of the cool kids then), and even the way people treated me. When I was swanning around in dresses, nobody batted an eye, but put me in a t-shirt and suddenly people were asking me questions like I knew what I was talking about. I’d become part of the group, and because I’d done this so fast, people assumed that Id been there for ages!

As well as creating a sense of cohesion, people genuinely enjoy wearing their favourite “brands”. Tech people are lucky insofar that brands also want us to wear (and promote) them. Choice in tshirts showcases what you're interested in, and lets you find similarly minded people without too much effort. It's far easier than rebooting your phone every five minutes to show Cyanogenmod’s boot screen, and doesn’t die as fast as stickers (bonus: tshirts are more practical than either of these).

Really, t-shirts are like medals for us nerds; we get a sense of cohesion with our fellow coders, we get rewarded for doing cool things, and we don't have to wear suits. So next time you do a cool thing, grab a t-shirt on your way out and wear it with pride. There’s a good chance the rest of us are staring at you enviously. 

Really, I prefer my own clothing
--------------------------------

Do you wear your company's branded t-shirt to work? If you do, here's some advice, free of charge.

STOP IT.

Seriously, just fucking stop. You're being played, by THE MAN. While it might seem great that you get free clothes and no longer have to waste your precious brain cycles on meaningless fashion, you're sacrificing your individuality for the benefit of a corporation that doesn't give a shit about you.

Ok, maybe they do care about you, and their motto is something sweet like "don't be evil" or "don't fuck the customer". Even if it is and you concede that capitalism is a necessary part of modernity, no corporation deserves your undying love and blind trust. Wearing a corporate shirt is nothing like wearing a shirt for your favourite band or artist, because you can love art, but you can't love a revenue-stream for a bunch of middle-aged white men.

One of the perks of working in tech is that you don't have to wear a suit, but if you wear the company shirt and rock it at Wynyard, aren't you even more of a slave to your job than those squares who work in banks? All the counter-cultural cred you built up watching Silicon Valley and Mr Robot disappears the instant that comfy cotton sack slides over your head.

If wearing a company shirt provides you with a sense of community, it's misdirected. You can still feel united with your colleagues without looking the same as them. Buy a bunch of cheap shirts from an op-shop and show your affection at lunch, drinks and in your interactions at work.

Perhaps this article has rubbed you up the wrong way. It's supposed to. But I'm not here to declare war on *people*, I want a war of ideas. We've all got to pay rent, and if that involves inserting ads for fake vomit into Google maps and sending marketing spam in bulk, then so be it. You shouldn't surrender your individuality and free thought though, because without them, does anything of value remain?
