2 May
:    Vim Workshop\hfill\bcalTech{} 

     _2--3pm, Viola/Cello lab (level 3 of J17)_

    Vim is a text editor. It can run in a terminal, over ssh or as it's own app. But 
    what's the big deal? Well, Vim is quite powerful, and mastering it will allow 
    you to write code much faster. However, Vim has quite a steep learning curve if 
    you wish to utilise its full power - that's where this workshop comes in!

    Come along, and learn to edit text at the speed of thought!

    Check out the Facebook event at https://www.facebook.com/events/2007642076128620/

    PS. If you want to come extra prepared, type 'vimtutor' at the terminal. 
    PPS. If you already know a bit of Vim, feel free to join in too - you might learn something new.
