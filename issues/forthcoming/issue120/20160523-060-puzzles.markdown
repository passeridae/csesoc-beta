A.
:    The solution to the swapping connundrum is known as a XOR swap! An example is 
     below:
     \begin{verbatim}
     void g (int *a, int *b) {
       if (a != b) {
         *x ^= *y;
         *y ^= *x;
         *x ^= *y;
       }
     }
     \end{verbatim}

B.
:    You could not kill the malicious processes because as soon as the memory was 
     freed, one of its children would fork a replacement. However, UNIX offers us a 
     way to stop a process from doing anything, while keeping its resources 
     allocated. You can send each instance the STOP signal as follows:
     \begin{verbatim}
     kill -STOP $offending_process_id
     \end{verbatim}

     Where $offending_proccess_id is the pid of one of the original processes. You 
     may then kill the processes at your leisure.

     (Note that even though you cannot run any new processes, this solution works 
     because kill is a bash builtin and runs within the shell's own process.)
