Words of the Week
=================

Every week, we bring you the latest and greatest in Jargon, be it obscure or otherwise. Where does this Jargon come from, you ask? Why, the Jargon Files of course, the internet's favourite place for all things *hacker*. Have fun! These weeks words are:


**fish**: [Adelaide University, Australia] 
1. Another metasyntactic variable. See foo. Derived originally from the Monty Python skit in the middle of The Meaning of Life entitled Find the Fish. 
2. A pun for microfiche. A microfiche file cabinet may be referred to as a fish tank.


**tourist**:
1. [ITS] A guest on the system, especially one who generally logs in over a network from a remote location for comm mode, email, games, and other trivial purposes. One step below luser. ITS hackers often used to spell this turist, perhaps by some sort of tenuous analogy with luser (this usage may also have expressed the ITS culture's penchant for six-letterisms, and/or been some sort of tribute to Alan Turing). Compare twink, lurker, read-only user. 
2. [IRC] An IRC user who goes from channel to channel without saying anything; see channel hopping.


**lose lose**: A reply to or comment on an undesirable situation. “I accidentally deleted all my files!” “Lose, lose.”
