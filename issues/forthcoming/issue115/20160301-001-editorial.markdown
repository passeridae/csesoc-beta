Editorial
=========

Hello, and welcome to a year full of fun, adventures, and \csesocbeta\. 
Jashank called it early in last year; I've braved the horrors within the
\csesocbeta\ build and styles, and survived, and taken over the role he 
so coveted. Sorry, not sorry?

I have high hopes for this year with technical content, non-technical 
content and even a story or two. We're aiming to run the gamut from technology
to computer science (surprise), to logic and mathematics with a side of 
music, movies and books. Plus events! We have lots of those. As per last year, 
this entire magazine is produced using \LaTeX\, and none of us have died yet.

As ever, if you've stumbled on anything interesting, or you're keen to
get involved, join the team via the CSESoc website and get with us!

See you on the other side.
