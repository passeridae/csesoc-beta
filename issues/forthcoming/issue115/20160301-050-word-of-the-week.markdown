Words of the Week
=================

\multicols{2}

Every week, we bring you the latest and greatest in Jargon, be it obscure or 
otherwise. Where does this Jargon come from, you ask? Why, the Jargon Files 
of course, the internet's favourite place for all things *hacker*. Have fun! 
These weeks words are:


**hacked off**: [analogous to ‘pissed off’] Said of system administrators who 
have become annoyed, upset, or touchy owing to suspicions that their sites have 
been or are going to be victimized by crackers, or used for inappropriate, 
technically illegal, or even overtly criminal activities. For example, having 
unreadable files in your home directory called ‘worm’, ‘lockpick’, or ‘goroot’ 
would probably be an effective (as well as impressively obvious and stupid) way 
to get your sysadmin hacked off at you.


**RTFAQ**: [Usenet: primarily written, by analogy with RTFM] Abbrev. for ‘Read 
the FAQ!’, an exhortation that the person addressed ought to read the newsgroup's 
FAQ list before posting questions.


**nybble**: [from v. nibble by analogy with ‘bite’ -> ‘byte’] Four bits; one hex 
digit; a half-byte. Though ‘byte’ is now techspeak, this useful relative is still 
jargon. Compare byte; see also bit. The more mundane spelling “nibble” is also 
commonly used. Apparently the ‘nybble’ spelling is uncommon in Commonwealth Hackish.

Following ‘bit’, ‘byte’ and ‘nybble’ there have been quite a few analogical attempts 
to construct unambiguous terms for bit blocks of other sizes. All of these are 
strictly jargon, not techspeak, and not very common jargon at that (most hackers 
would recognize them in context but not use them spontaneously). We collect them 
here for reference together with the ambiguous techspeak terms ‘word’, ‘half-word’, 
‘double word’, and ‘quad’ or quad word; some (indicated) have substantial 
information separate entries.

2 bits: crumb. quad, quarter, tayste, tydbit, morsel

4 bits: nybble

5 bits: nickle

10 bits: deckle

16 bits: playte, chawmp (on a 32-bit machine), word (on a 16-bit machine), half-word (on a 32-bit machine)

18 bits: chawmp (on a 36-bit machine), half-word (on a 36-bit machine)

32 bits: dynner, gawble (on a 32-bit machine), word (on a 32-bit machine), longword (on a 16-bit machine)

36 bits: word (on a 36-bit machine)

48 bits: gawble (under circumstances that remain obscure)

64 bits: double word (on a 32-bit machine) quad (on a 16-bit machine)

128 bits: quad (on a 320bit machine)

The fundamental motivation for most of these jargon terms (aside from the normal 
hackerly enjoyment of punning wordplay) is the extreme ambiguity of the term word 
and its derivatives.
