    eth1: a day-long programming contest. Form teams and hack together a trading bot to compete against others 
    and the markets.
    
    Each member of the winning team will receive AU$0x3ff. There'll be lots of (free) food and drink available.
    
    Absolutely no special math, OCaml, or finance knowledge is required; you can use any language you like. 
    The contest is entirely technical in nature and you won't need any visual design skills. The exact details 
    of the hackathon aren't released until the competition begins. The one thing you can do ahead of time to prepare 
    is familiarize yourself with the libraries for writing TCP clients in your programming language of choice.
