The CSESoc Team, 2015
=====================

\begin{center}\vspace{-1ex}
{\large\it Meet your society team!}
\end{center}
\multicols{2}

Co-Presidents
-------------

\begin{center}
\tikz\node[circle,inner sep=.125\linewidth,fill overzoom image=images/heads-dadisusila.png] (A) {};
\tikz\node[circle,inner sep=.125\linewidth,fill overzoom image=images/heads-otan.png] (A) {};

{\it \textbf{Davina~Adisusila}, 3rd Year Computer Science \\
  \& \textbf{Oliver~Tan}, 3rd Year Computer Science}
\end{center}

Leading your society this year are two powerhouses of, well, power:
the inimitable Oliver Tan, who still hasn't been found since the last
time he was running shirtless around the Village Green howling in
Cantonese (and who still can only be kept calm with the quadratic
formula in iambic pentameter), and the indefatigable Davina Adisusila,
who, thankfully, _knows_ the quadratic formula in iambic pentameter,
and in her off-time, plays 1v1 laser-tag (and wins).

Davina and Oliver are already off to a flying start, bringing on board
a raft of new sponsors, and preparing the team for a busy year ahead.

Secretary
---------

\begin{center}
\tikz\node[circle,inner sep=.125\linewidth,fill overzoom image=images/heads-osoegyono.jpg] (A) {};

{\it \textbf{Octavia~Soegyono}, 2nd Year Computer Science}
\end{center}

With the aid of her mighty enforcer, Octavia keeps everyone honest and
organised in the role of secretary.  Keeping tabs on everything and
everyone, you can count on her to know the minutiae of any and all
goings-on of the society.

Treasurer
---------

\begin{center}
\tikz\node[circle,inner sep=.125\linewidth,fill overzoom image=images/heads-lpickup.png] (A) {};

{\it \textbf{Lucas~Pickup}, 3rd Year Computer Science}
\end{center}

Pioneering efforts in reducing CSESoc's funding footprint by baring
said feet, Lucas is back and brings all his skill and ingenuity to
keeping the weekly barbecue funded.

Arc Delegate
------------

\begin{center}
\tikz\node[circle,inner sep=.125\linewidth,fill overzoom image=images/heads-karlk.png] (A) {};

{\it \textbf{Karl~Mihael~Zlatko~Hong-Giang~Krauth}, \\
  4th Year Computer Science/Mathematics}
\end{center}

Karl's name not only matches the dimensions of his glorious, groomed
mane: it also matches the magnitude of his skill at dealing with the
bureaucracy of Arc.  And, oh yes, if you look at him at just the right
angle, in just the right light, you might catch a glimpse of his inner
Julian Saknussem.

Social Heads
------------

\begin{center}
\tikz\node[circle,inner sep=.125\linewidth,fill overzoom image=images/heads-jbloom.jpg] (A) {};
\tikz\node[circle,inner sep=.125\linewidth,fill overzoom image=images/heads-sstr.jpg] (A) {};

{\it \textbf{Jake~Bloom}, 2nd Year Computer Science \\
  \& \textbf{Steven~Strijakov}, 2nd Year Computer Science}
\end{center}

Two classy individuals are the masterminds of a whole raft of
spectacular events, including our weekly barbecue, and in just a few
weeks, First Year Camp.

Those two folks are Jake "The Mighty Waratahs" Bloom, who can be found
a couple of pages across, regaling his experiences of First Year Camp,
and Steven "Pepper" Strijakov, who really, really, _really_ loves
pepper on his sausages.

Publicity Head
--------------

\begin{center}
\tikz\node[circle,inner sep=.125\linewidth,fill overzoom image=images/heads-lchan.png] (A) {};

{\it \textbf{Lavender~Chan}, 3rd Year Software Engineering}
\end{center}

Lavender is _still_ active in just about everything, and this year,
she's carrying the mantle of Publicity head, so just about everything
of CSESoc's that looks good can probably be attributed to her,
somehow.

Beta Head
---------

\begin{center}
\tikz\node[circle,inner sep=.125\linewidth,fill overzoom image=images/heads-jashankj.png] (A) {};

{\it \textbf{Jashank~Jeremy}, 2nd Year Computer Science}
\end{center}

Jashank has immense difficulty talking about himself in the third
person.  He also takes a disturbing amount of pleasure at bending
\LaTeX\ to his will, and derives a spectacular amount of discomfort
from ugly and/or poorly laid-out works, so this year, Beta looks
rather distinctive.

Dev Head
--------

\begin{center}
\tikz\node[circle,inner sep=.125\linewidth,fill overzoom image=images/heads-gcaley.jpg] (A) {};

{\it \textbf{George~Caley}, 3rd Year Computer Science}
\end{center}

George maintains a mop of hair as a protective shield while doing
server maintenance, and, and, given that he maintains a server called
GLaDOS, it's little wonder that it's necessary.

He's also the goto person when it comes to the CSESoc website or Bark,
even though he regularly reminds us that goto is considered harmful,
and in partnership with the Talkshops team, he's working on bringing
more student software development to \CSE.

CompClub Head
-------------

\begin{center}
\tikz\node[circle,inner sep=.125\linewidth,fill overzoom image=images/heads-jlim.jpg] (A) {};

{\it \textbf{Jason~Lim}, 3rd Year Software/Biomedical Engineering}
\end{center}

Jason is a key person in bringing the magic of computer science to
high schools, with CompClub.  Unfortunately, due to budget cuts, the
entire team and all their equipment must fit on his bicycle to get
from school to school.

DevSpace Heads
--------------

\begin{center}
\tikz\node[circle,inner sep=.125\linewidth,fill overzoom image=images/heads-mmcewen.jpg] (A) {};
\tikz\node[circle,inner sep=.125\linewidth,fill overzoom image=images/heads-jelliott.jpg] (A) {};

{\it \textbf{Matthew~McEwen}, 3rd Year Computer Engineering \\
  \& \textbf{Joshua~Elliott}, 3rd Year Computer Science}
\end{center}

DevSpace is truly awesome, so naturally two truly awesome people are
responsible for keeping it active, and they are Matt McEwen, who's
currently in hiding out in Canada (!) due to crimes against Arduinos
(!!), and Joshua Elliott, who _should_ be on the run for crimes
against violins.

TalkShops Heads
---------------

\begin{center}
\tikz\node[circle,inner sep=.125\linewidth,fill overzoom image=images/heads-jcaw.png] (A) {};
\tikz\node[circle,inner sep=.125\linewidth,fill overzoom image=images/heads-dsison.jpg] (A) {};

{\it \textbf{John~Wiseheart}, 3rd Year Computer Science \\
  \& \textbf{David~Sison}, 2nd Year Computer Engineering}
\end{center}

John and David are turning their hand to managing the talks and
workshops that fill the CSESoc calendar, bringing the brightest minds
and sharpest people to \CSE---usually _back_ to \CSE.  And with a
goals list that contains "_hev fun_" twice, and some fantastic events
planned already, it's well worthwhile keeping tabs on the calendar.

John isn't one to shy away from a good workshop, especially if it
involves IKEA furniture; David is an unusually highly strung musician,
noted for having difficulties with Windows and skill with sharding
problems that make him excellently suited to distributing talks.

Student Network Head
--------------------

\begin{center}
\tikz\node[circle,inner sep=.125\linewidth,fill overzoom image=images/heads-cmanou.jpg] (A) {};

{\it \textbf{Christopher~Manouvrier}, \\
  5th Year Software Engineering/Physics}
\end{center}

Ever the party animal, Chris is our StuNet head this year, although
most of the time he's procrastinating from doing anything.
