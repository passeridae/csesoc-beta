Words of the Week
=================

Every week, we bring you the latest and greatest in Jargon, be it obscure or otherwise. Where does this Jargon come from, you ask? Why, the Jargon Files of course, the internet's favourite place for all things *hacker*. Have fun! These weeks words are:


**playpen**: [IBM] A room where programmers work. Compare salt mines.


**Vulcan Nerve Pinch**: [from the old Star Trek TV series via Commodore Amiga hackers] The keyboard combination that forces a soft-boot or jump to ROM monitor (on machines that support such a feature). On Amigas this is <Ctrl>-<Left-Amiga>-<Right-Amiga>; on PC clones this is Ctrl-Alt-Del; on Suns, L1-A; on Macintoshes, it is <Cmd>-<Power switch> or <Cmd>-<Ctrl>-<Power>! On IRIX, <Left-Ctrl><Left-Shift><F12><Keypad-Slash>, which kills and restarts the X server, is sometimes called a vulcan nerve pinch. Also called three-finger salute and Vulcan death grip. At shops with a lot of Microsoft Windows machines, this is often called the Microsoft Maneuver because of the distressing frequency with which Microsoft's unreliable software requires it. Compare quadruple bucky.


**WIMP environment**: [acronym: ‘Window, Icon, Menu, Pointing device (or Pull-down menu)’] A graphical-user-interface environment such as X or the Macintosh interface, esp. as described by a hacker who prefers command-line interfaces for their superior flexibility and extensibility. However, it is also used without negative connotations; one must pay attention to voice tone and other signals to interpret correctly. See menuitis, user-obsequious.
