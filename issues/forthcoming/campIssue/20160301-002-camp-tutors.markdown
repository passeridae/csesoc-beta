**Joseph**
Joseph is a second year Computer Science and Science student whose interests range from web development to robots and artificial intelligence. He has a penchant for industrial design and programming interactive lighting displays. Given his noticeable height advantage, his volleyball team will definitely have an edge in games. And forget long walks on the beach, swimming before a bowl of ramen is the way to go when relaxing on a nice, sunshine-y day. With three cats at home, he braves his allergies and shows nature who is boss. As CompClub head he also manages to bequeath his knowledge onto the ‘younger generation’ and spread the CSE lifestyle to those who wouldn’t know otherwise.


**Jath**
Jathurson Subachandran was born in a volcano on August 31st, 1996. Remember that date because "Jath" always makes a big deal of his birthday. He brings the same heat and energy that a volcano does to everything he does, and rumour has it that Mark Ronson's hook in "Uptown Funk" (I'm too hot, hot damn) was actually written about Jathurson. A free spirit, Jath will always say what he is thinking, whether appropriate or not. One of the friendlier people on the planet, you'll find him on the campsite bossing leaders around or making friends with first years!

Degree: Computer Science
Meme ability: dank/10
Interesting Fact: I have two Weetbix in warmed-up soy milk.
First Year Helpful Tip: Don't look the socialist alternative petitioners in the eye when you walk past the library - they'll remember you forever.

**George**
George is a serious dank memer. He is the kind of guy who would never pass on a rare Pepe. He loves programming dank meme generators with C, and plays guitar whilst wearing a fedora. George loves to play League of Legends. His favourite movie is Scott Pilgrim vs The World.  Rumor has it that only he knows the right amount and type of sausages to order for the CSESoc weekly BBQ.

**Jake**
Sporting his signature tank top, boardies and flip flops, Jake Bloom sure doesn’t look like your typical CSE student. In fact, in many ways he is not. Voted designated bogan at FYC 2014, Jake can often be found cheering at a Waratahs game with a stubby in hand, or in front of a barbie listening to the freshest tunes on Triple J. But don’t let looks deceive; Jake is a programmer at heart! He is also an all-round approachable and nice guy, just don’t get into a conversation with him whether or not eSports are real sports.


**Justin**
The Almighty Justin Keevers is a man of many skills. He started his humble life on the 9th of April in the year that was called “The best year in movie history”, which explains his astonishing acting skills. Later in his life he attended the “1st Caringbah Scouts” where he made great friend and had a great time learning some great skills and go karting. His high school life was better where he continued to grow and prosper through puberty and adolescence. His true growth to a man wasn’t till he graduated high school in 2013 and started university as a computer Science student, where he new and exciting people. During the year of 2014 Justin decided to take it upon himself to embark on the adventure of his life time and decided to join cse revues cast, here he had the time of his life and proved to the world that he is truly an astounding actor


**Yuvraj**
Yuvraj is a 2nd year student, growing up in south-western Sydney. In his spare time, he enjoys doing dishes and mopping the floor - simple things where you can see your progress. When he has to, he chills on his computer and plays games online, as well as hanging out with friends, playing pool and other similar group activities. When he graduates he’d like to join a programming company with interesting projects, or perhaps delve into the video game development industry.


**Jesse**
He seems like a sensible guy, programming Python on his Thinkpad Yoga, but don't be fooled. This guy is a party animal - and not just any animal, that's right: “a magical magic horse" (better known as a unicorn). You might know him for his devious plots involving the (mis-)placement of bollards, or as the guy who tried to get through airport security with pockets stuffed with USB car chargers. But no matter how many lists he is on, at the end of the day Jesse Is a helpful guy who believes in hard work: "If it's worth doing, it's worth overdoing”


**Adam**
As one of CSESocs finest gentlemen, Adam is the smooth talking, sauve Talkshops head, charming his way into the minds of our sponsors. When he's not breaking the hearts of many, he can be found drinking a smooth whisky on the rocks, eating his favourite meal at his local delight, Ribs and Rumps. He has been featured many times on UNSW Love Letters and makes the occasional appearance on the @hotdudeswithdogs Instagram page. As the master of many talents, be sure to ask Adam for a serenade under the moonlight, or beside the campfire. However you must beware, many have fainted in delight at the dulcet sounds of the trombone playing, trumpet playing Adam

**Nicola**
Nicola… she hates marshmallows. Yep. You read that right. Marshmallows are just “sticky chewy sugar”, and toasted marshmallows are even worse.

Despite this, Nicola is one of the loveliest human beings you could ever possibly meet. She’s in her 4th year and studying mechatronics/comp sci, and loves to cook (I really hope she helps wellbeing for CSE revue again this year, we worship our food Gods). She has also made some of the dankest drawings and graphical artwork you will ever lay eyes on, so prepare to be dankified. In her spare time, she enjoys sitting in socs office and talking about nothing.

She’s got firsthand experience at Google so if you’re curious about life at one of the biggest and front-running tech companies, she’s a fantastic resource. Oh and her soul belongs to Google. So if you are intent on stealing her soul, you’ll have to barter with them (good luck).


**Octavia**
Octavia is a third year Computer Science and Science student and is president and producer of CSE Revue, leading the team of incredible performers and crew. Outside of her duties to the allegiance she devotes herself to her interests in Psychology and development of video games, particularly with character designs. Her favourite sport is the regular exercising of sleep. Octavia travels regularly and has visited many parts of Asia and has a thirst for more. With her incredible height leaves her with the extraordinary ability to disguise as a first year. Watch out as she might just be sitting opposite YOU!


**Nick**
Nick Whyte, he’s alright, quite polite, pretty bright, got his own website, I’m running out of rhymes to write; this was a bad idea in hindsight. Nick’s a meme guy who likes danks. He’s also a keen cyclist and an 3L1T3 H4X0R with a kickass five monitor Hackintosh setup. He enjoys the challenge of solving problems through electronics and programming, whether it be building his own network-attached storage device or hacking a Raspberry Pi to a sprinkler system to control them remotely through an iPhone app. Nick’s mastered programming to such an extent that he can write algorithms so advanced they can predict the future – accurately calculating the top three spots of Triple J's Hottest 100 for last year. Feel free to ask him for upcoming lotto numbers or the next Melbourne Cup winner. Or just ask to hang out with him because he’s a cool guy!


**David**
Few words can describe David, who leaves everyone he meets speechless. He is an active member of multiple societies including pcsoc and cse revue, demonstrating his convincing acting skills in 2015 as Emmet for the Lego Revue. He does not enjoy helping his parents around the house, instead spending his time playing games such as TF2. David has a creative mind, and often enjoys narrating in games of Mafia, which may result in a dinosaur serial killer who chooses to oven his victims, and effective gangs shooting down their own


**Weilon**
Weilon Ying is a self-described "artificially intelligent whale", one of the first to pass the turing test and politely talk his way out of a secret facility in Liechtenstein. When he isn't acting in CSE Revue, getting people interested in hacking and information security, or administrating the UNSW minecraft server, he spends what little time he has remaining in the K17 basement, hanging out in the SOCS office, as well as in the Business School, assuming his commerce buddies aren't bombarding him with computer problems. You have this bio author's permission to bombard him with computer problems, however.


**Carmen**
Carmen Wang is a cat. Not in physical form, but her spirit is that of a cat, trapped in a human body. She hides the pain of bearing a non-human soul through the excessive use of puns, and by drinking whiskey straight from the bottle. Don't mistake the smile that's always on her face as happiness - it's just her human mask (cats don't smile). She's unsure how she feels about bugs: her cat soul tells her to pounce and kill, but her human body refuses. She often compromises by screaming and running away. She hopes that one day the world will accept her for who she truly is, but until they she takes comfort in the fact that no one on the internet knows she's a cat


**John**
John, dubbed "cauliflower" by an unnamed source due to his curly, pale locks, is a fourth year computer science student. His hobbies are eating and sleeping—he proudly professes that he is always doing one or the other and has been since birth with no breaks in between. John has stated that his favourite lecturer is Wobcke, but speculation exists around whether or not he was held captive or blackmailed when he made the statement


**Ryan**
Ryan is a 2nd year CSE student who enjoys acting, bike rides and the occasional walks along the beach. He can be found at times enjoying his mum delicious pasta bake that smells really really really good when microwaved. 
While Ryan Reynolds may be Deadpool, Ryan Klugman is Deadcool. And although he doesn’t, well hopefully doesn’t, carry around sharp knives and his wit is sure to cut. He can transform into the ultimate sass queen quicker than you can put on the superman outfit he wore in last year’s CSE Revue.
If you see him around, don’t be afraid to strike up a conversation. He super easy to talk to and genuinely a cool guy. Just don’t get too distracted by his super long eyelashes and sparkly eyes


**Lavender**
Lavender Chan, 4th year Computer Science. Lavender still hasn’t figured out how to graduate yet, so she resorts to serving you all as a marvellous Co-President. She can often be found slumbering on a couch in the CSESoc office getting high on coffee and vocally expressing her opinions on every CSESoc Publicity poster ever made. After having a brutal year trying to extract money from Arc in 2014, she now channels her memories and powers of persuasion to deliver CSESoc an awesome set of sponsors this year.


**DP**
Daniel Phillips is a second year Computer Science student, who also likes DP (dynamic programming, what were you thinking?), is Workshops Head for CSESoc, and Secretary of the Security Society. He has a passion for programming, hacking, and dank memes. Last year he travelled to New Zealand for Kiwicon (to see the pink sheep). YES… is one of his favourite bands, as well as Pink Floyd. Daniel has a rare medical condition that forces his brain to grow outside of his head as well as inside. Many people confuse his outer brain for hair, as it is similar in colour and texture, but don’t be fooled. He has a severe phobia of getting haircuts, as his IQ drops by 5 for every centimetre of hair he loses (it grows back though)


**Neil**
Neil. Software engineer, food lover, follower of the flying spaghetti monster. As far as culture goes, he’s definitely more on the weird side of the spectrum, but he doesn’t exactly wear that on his sleeve. Once you get him talking, though, it will become increasingly apparent that while he may like to think of himself as just like everybody else (and by some definition he certainly is; he is human after all), most people don't see him that way. And that's fine with him. He often finds himself gravitating towards people who are weird themselves. You probably are too. In his free time, he makes nerdy software for musicians, artists, and experimenters to indulge in their own weirdness. In his own words; “I am a hours worth of whether I seek to bend spoons with, just give me a good salting.”


**Emily**
This is Emily’s bio based on her Facebook profile picture. Emily likes pirates, red flowers, red beads and red hair. I think she likes the colour red but to be honest I’m not really sure. Her eyes can see things from what i can tell. Also she has a mouth which is really cool. I’m pretty sure Emily is studying a degree at UNSW. Emily is a first year camp leader. Be like Emily.
