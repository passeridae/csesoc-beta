=========

Hello, hello, and welcome back from mid-semester break; to get you
back into the swing of it, here's what's left of \csesocbeta\ for this
week.

I should also apologise for last week's glitch in the printed version.
I now know a disturbing amount more than I used to about the way CUPS
works, the way that our printers work, and have an immense amount of
gratitude to the team in SS for helping me fight the printer.

Printing on Linux now is akin to what audio was like there, ten years
ago.  A solved problem everywhere else, to boot.

As ever, if you've stumbled on anything interesting, or you're keen to
get involved, join the team via the CSESoc website, or send in an
article---`beta@cse.unsw.edu.au`.  We'd love to hear from you!

Enjoy this (disturbingly sparse) issue.
