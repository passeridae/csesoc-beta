__iiNet forced to identify seeders.__
The Federal Court has decided in favour of copyright trolls
Dallas Buyers Club LLC in their case against iiNet, an Australian
ISP. The verdict allows DBC to distribute legal threats to iiNet
customers observed seeding their awful film. Threats will likely
demand cash in order to avoid a month in court. Expect more
torrent shakedowns from aggrieved multimedia millionaires in your
near future.

__Netflix chokes urban internet.__
The Australian launch of film and TV streaming service Netflix
has been fairly successful, insofar as many people seem to have
subscribed and they are all trying to use it at the same
time. Since the launch, domestic internet traffic has doubled,
and netizens have reported unusually high packet loss during the
evening peak.

__Just keep buying new games, OK?__
A DMCA exemption request from the Electronic Frontier Foundation to
permit the modification of older games in order to resurrect abandoned
multiplayer servers has not gone down well with gaming industry trade
groups. The Entertainment Software Association argued that any
technique enabling such behaviour would be equivalent to piracy, and
they would prefer you just pump more cash into ESA member organisations.

__CSIRO logo survives Cisco attack.__
The CSIRO's logo has been successfully registered as a
trademark. This would not be news if not for Cisco's unsuccessful
attempt to block it, arguing it was too similar to their own. The
CSIRO logo is a series of vertical bars shaping out Australia,
while Cisco's vertical bars draw the Golden Gate Bridge, a
landmark often confused for an entire island continent.

__Apple product launches.__
Apple's Watch and new 12" MacBook have launched, and both are
fairly confusing products. The MacBook's keyboard has hit a new
low, and in my testing, the system struggled while
scrolling a PDF. Though the screen is pretty, the maximum
effective resolution is 1440x900.  The Watch suffers from the
same existential angst as the cheaper smartwatches, with a bonus
dose of conspicuous wealth display.

__Mac OS X privilege escalation.__
The latest update to Mac OS X closes a local privilege escalation
bug that has been present since 2011. An unprivileged user could
gain root by sending a `nil` value to an authentication function
that expected identifying information. Objective-C treats a
method call on a `nil` object as a no-op, so permissions checks
could be bypassed.

__.sucks TLD racket.__
ICANN are concerned by the high prices domain registrars are
charging for the new `.sucks` TLD. Given companies are duty-bound
to purchase these domain names, lest they fall into the hands of
angry Yelp reviewers, registration at US$2,499 starts to look a
little bit like a shakedown. ICANN will assess the legality of
registrar Vox Populi's operation before acting.

__Swarm fascism.__
As a reminder that cheap and ubiquitous drones have horrifying
implications for warfare and policing, Indian police have begin
equipping them with pepper spray for crowd control. Suddenly the
dream of an automatically-delivered burrito or Amazon package
seems a little petty.

__Russian meme crackdown.__
The Russian media overseer Roskomnadzor has clarified its
position on defamation law, and in the process seem to have
outlawed most memes, foreign and domestic. Depicting public
figures in a manner they might not like is now fully in
breach. Image macros mocking celebrities and politicians
supposedly harm their "honor, dignity and business."
