CSE Student Representatives
===========================

\multicols{2}

The stureps (student representatives) are an elected body of students
whose main purpose is to help facilitate communication between the
staff and students at CSE.  They report to the School (unlike student
societies).

There are a number of things which Stureps can help students with,
such as:

- Ideas for improving things at CSE;
- Providing anonymous complaints to CSE;
- Representing students on the CSE Teaching and Computing Committees;

The stureps can help you find the right person, or speak to them on
your behalf.  All communication with them will be kept confidential
unless otherwise specified.
