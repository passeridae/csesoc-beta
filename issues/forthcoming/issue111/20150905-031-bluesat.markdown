BLUEsat
=======

Come check out BLUEsat! We're the \UNSW\ student space society, focused
on making satellites and off-world rovers.  We're always looking for
interested students from all degrees and majors.

For students deciding to major in \CSE, we currently have great
projects that you can get involved in, developing software for the
on-board computer, flight control systems, and more. You can also join
the robotics team, and work on developing the code to allow the rover
to navigate a Martian desert.

If that sounds like something you're interested in, come to our Open
Day stalls at either the Ainsworth Building, located near the center
of campus, or Tyree, near Anzac Parade.
