Welcome to UNSW, CSE, and Beta!
===============================

\multicols{2}

Hello!  Welcome to \UNSW, to the Faculty of Engineering, to the School
of Computer Science and Engineering, and to Beta!  We're a fortnightly
student paper, filled with a veritable bazaar of carefully curated
content.

On Open Day, you can find all kinds of cool stuff to do, but, if you
feel anything like I did on my first visit to a \UNSW\ Open Day---a
few years ago, now---it all probably seems a bit overwhelming.

But don't worry!  \UNSW\ is one of the most fun, academically charged,
socially active universities in Sydney and in Australia, so don't
doubt that you'll make friends, learn, and discover something new.

On behalf of \CSE's students and staff, we hope you enjoy Open Day,
wish you all the very best with your future, and hope to see you at
\CSE\ soon!
