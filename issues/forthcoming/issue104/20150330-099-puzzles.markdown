Brain Teasers

A.
:    You have a biased coin which lands heads with some probability p,
     and tails with some probability $1-p$.  It's approaching midsem,
     and you need to find a fair way to decide who has to write the
     unit tests for your pair project.  How can you do this using only
     that coin?

B.
:    You have attained a highly coveted job wherein you spend your
     days being given little pieces of paper with numbers on them by a
     hovering, mysterious benefactor.  The pieces of paper are being
     handed to you quickly, thus you must not spend more than
     $\log_2n$ operations putting them in front of you.  Furthermore,
     your mysterious benefactor asks you at random points for the
     median of all the numbers on all the pieces of paper you've been
     given thus far.  This benefactor is impatient, so you want to
     deliver the answer as fast as possible (i.e., in constant time) to
     avoid reprimand.  How do you go about this?

The goal of this problem is to fill the grid with 1 and 0.  The rules
of the game are:

1. each line has the same number of 1s and 0s;
2. no more than two consecutive cells may contain the same digit; and
3. each row and each column have to be unique.
