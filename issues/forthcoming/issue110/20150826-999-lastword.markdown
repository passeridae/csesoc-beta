The Last Word
=============

\multicols{2}

Well, here we are: the end of another week's Beta.  I hope you enjoyed
it, and hey, we did too.

...

Anyhow, that's enough of me rambling on.  If you've stumbled across
anything interesting, or you're keen to get involved, join the team
via the CSESoc website, or send in an
article---`beta@cse.unsw.edu.au`.  We'd love to hear from you, and
hey, your article will very likely end up in print.

Catch you next week!
