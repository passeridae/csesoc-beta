Editorial
=========

Hello, and welcome back to \csesocbeta{} for 2015!

My name's Jashank, and I'm the new head of CSESoc's Beta team.  I'm
looking forward to working with CSE students and staff, as well as the
rest of the CSESoc team, to produce a magazine that's as interesting
and relevant as we can make it.

You've probably noticed a rather dramatic change in the appearance of
our little publication.  I should also note that it is entirely done
using \LaTeX\ (Lua\LaTeX, in fact).

Appearance-wise _and_ content-wise, there are changes: our structure
is in flux, but rest assured, there will be a big emphasis on
technology, as well as computer science, logic, and mathematics; but
we also aim to have some variety, including music, movies, and books.
And, of course, you'll have comprehensive listings of upcoming events
brought to you by CSESoc (as well as some Arc and UNSW events).

So, if this is the first time you've ever picked up a copy of
\csesocbeta{}, or if you've seen this magazine before, pick up a copy
and find out what's new inside!
