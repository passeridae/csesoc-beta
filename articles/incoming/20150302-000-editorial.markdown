\section{Editorial}

Hello, and welcome back to \csesocbeta{} for 2015!

My name's Jashank, and I'm the new head of CSESoc's Beta team.  I'm
looking forward to working with CSE students and staff, as well as
the rest of the CSESoc team, to produce a magazine that's as
interesting and relevant as we can make it.

This issue has two main purposes: the first is as an experiment to see
what content people enjoy in this magazine, and for that reason, our
structure is very much in flux.  Rest assured, there will be a big
emphasis on technology, as well as computer science, logic, and
mathematics; but we also aim to have some variety, including music,
movies, and books.  And, of course, you'll have comprehensive listings
of upcoming events brought to you by CSESoc, Arc, and UNSW as a whole.

The second is to show off CSE (and CSESoc) during O-Week, during which
time, we hope to pick up a number of new students to be made more
awesome than before.

So, if this is the first time you've ever picked up a copy of
\csesocbeta{}, or if you've seen this magazine before, pick up a copy
and find out what's new inside!
