18 March
:    Lambda, the Ultimate Config Format\hfill\bcalTech{}  
     _10-11a, K17 Seminar Room_

    Complicated systems require expressive configuration
    languages.  But language design is hard; it's no surprise that many
    applications have either limited configurability or an unwieldy
    configuration format with complex semantics.

    At Jane Street, we have seen this problem enough times that we
    decided to start writing our configs the same way that we write
    our code, in OCaml. In this talk, we'll discuss our experiences
    using ocaml-plugin, a library we developed to embed OCaml within
    an application, providing a configuration language that is both
    expressive and familiar.

    Accenture is launching a brand new program called Women In
    Technology.  As part of this program we're running a series of
    events throughout the year to connect the best and brightest STEM
    students with successful women working in the technology industry.

    workshops designed to deepen your knowledge in the world of
    technology, and we'd like you to be involved!

    The first event to kick off the series will be a networking
    evening giving participants the opportunity to meet some of
    Accenture's Technology experts over drinks and canapes.
