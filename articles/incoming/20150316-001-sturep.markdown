2015 CSE Student Representatives
================================

\multicols{2}

The stureps (student representatives) are a body of students, voted in
by students, whose main purpose is to help facilitate communication
between the staff and students at CSE.  They report to the School
(unlike student societies).

This is an important role and only students with enough time and
commitment should stand for election.  The period will be for one
year.

There are a number of things which Stureps can help students with,
such as:

- Ideas for improving things at CSE;
- Providing anonymous complaints to CSE;
- Representing students on the CSE Teaching and Computing Committees;

The stureps can help you find the right person, or speak to them on
your behalf.  All communication with them will be kept confidential
unless otherwise specified.

Voting is now open for the 2015 CSE Student Representatives:

- Year 1 reps (2 positions)
- Year 2 reps (2 positions)
- Year 3 reps (2 positions)
- Year 4 and above reps (2 positions)
- Postgrad reps (2 positions) (no nominations)

Voting will close 18th March 2015 at 1pm.  You may vote as many times
as you like, but only your last vote will be counted.

If some years have two or less candidates we still require them to be
elected to indicate if they have support.
