\section{Welcome to CSE!}

On behalf of the \CSE\ Society, welcome to \CSE! What you're holding
is a copy of our society's fortnightly publication, \csesocbeta{}.

$\beta$eta is a student newsletter produced by students in \CSE\ for
students in \CSE. This means that $\beta$eta:

 - Bridges the gap between the staff and students of \CSE;
 - Keeps you up to date with some of the cutting-edge research done by
   our staff, postgrad and undergrad students;
 - Lets you know about the cool things \CSE\ students get up to in
   their spare time;
 - Allows students to express and debate their opinions; and
 - Keeps you entertained with fun segments, puzzles, crosswords and
   much more.

You can grab your copy of \csesocbeta{} at CSESoc's free weekly BBQ
(Mondays 12:30--1.30p on the Physics lawn) or at the student office on
the ground floor of K17.

This edition of \csesocbeta{} is an introduction that'll help you get
through that confusing first week where you're seeing new faces and
finding new places. Turn the pages to find out more about upcoming
events, what the society does, handy bookmarks you should have and
your frequently asked questions answered.

The entire Beta Team looks forward to keeping you informed and
entertained this year!
