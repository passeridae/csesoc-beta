The CSE Student Network
=======================

\multicols{2}

New to \CSE?  A Student Network mentor can help you find your feet.

The School of Computer Science and Engineering (\CSE) runs the
\CSE\ Student Network to assist you with your transition into life at
\CSE\ and \UNSW.  \CSE\ will assign a mentor to you personally, and
run group events.  The mentor will be a student in second year or
above.

This program is not academic---the mentors will not help you with
assignments, etc.  But they _will_ help you find your way around
\UNSW, give advice on opportunities, and help you form a social
network.  It's aimed at new undergraduate and postgraduate coursework
students.

You must register to participate:
