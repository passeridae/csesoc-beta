The CSE Student Network
=======================

\begin{center}\vspace{-1ex}
{\large\it New to CSE?  A Student Network mentor can help you find your feet.}
\end{center}
\multicols{2}

The School of Computer Science and Engineering (\CSE) runs the
\CSE\ Student Network to assist you with your transition into life at
\CSE\ and \UNSW.  \CSE\ will assign a mentor to you, and run group
events.  The mentor will be a second year (or above) student.

This program is not academic---the mentors will not help you with
assignments, etc.  But they _will_ help you find your way around
\UNSW, give advice on opportunities, and help you form a social
network.  It's aimed at new undergraduate and postgraduate coursework
students.

You must register to participate:
