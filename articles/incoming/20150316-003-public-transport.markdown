The Laws of Public Transportation
=================================

\multicols{2}

__First Law.__ Your conveyance of choice shall always be an amount of
  minutes late whereby it is of greatest convenience to you without
  also allowing you to seem justified in complaining about it

__Second law.__ Thy bus driver shall always be grumpy, unless you
  yourself are grumpy, in which case your driver shall be annoyingly
  chirpy.

__Third law.__ If, and only if, you are relying on your transport
  being the usual seven-to-ten minutes late it will, invariably, be
  driven by the only public transport officer in the Greater Sydney
  area capable of running ahead of schedule.

__Fourth Law.__ Thy bus shalt always be running on time when you are
  desperately late.  It shall then proceed to skip thy stop.

__Fifth Law.__ Thou shalt forget thy headphones only when there is a
  particularly gargantuan group of tourists being unreasonably loud
  sharing thy mode of transportation.

__Sixth Law.__ When traveling late on a Friday or Saturday night, or
  early the following morning, you will be forced to sit next to the
  very hungover individual who will likely throw up at least once
  during the journey. Plan accordingly.

__Seventh Law.__ You shall receive an incredibly important phone call
  at the least optimal time possible for your current journey.
  Examples of said inconvenience may include while your train goes
  through a tunnel as an indeterminatly large group of people attempt
  to sing _Blank Space_ by Taylor Swift, or have a violently passionate
  argument about their knowledge of llamas.

__Eighth Law.__ Thou shalt never be able to comprehend the guards
  announcements, until such a time as your train has left the platform
  you intended to get off at.
