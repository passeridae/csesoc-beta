First Year Camp
===============

On the 21st of March 2014, I walked into K17 wearing a Waratahs
singlet and cap.  I never missed a game, but on that Friday night, I
made an exception for the first time in years.  Class went slowly
throughout the day, and after I had finished up, I meandered down to
the Physics Lawn, where there were a group of First Year CSE students,
waiting and mingling.

It was the beginning of First Year Camp, a weekend that turned
University from a place where you could see friendly people into a
place where you could see your friends.  While we waited for the bus
to arrive, someone broke out a frisbee, and a game started.  A throw
came my way, just falling short of me.  I decided to do a dramatic
dive to pick it up, but it went to ground anyway.  Suddenly, a voice
behind me calls, "Use two hands Clarkey!" (in reference to Australian
Cricket Captain, Michael Clarke).  Standing above me, laughing, was
Pratoolya Kashyap.  Suddenly I made a friend.

During the next two hours spent waiting for the bus (we are using
better bus companies this year, I promise) Kirsten taught me about
Marshall Arts, Bernice taught me some words in Africaans, and Josh
spoke to me about his research in Artificial Intelligence.  I spoke to
them about rugby, the beach, and anything else that came into my head.
Suddenly, I had more friends.

Eventually we got to the campsite, in time for dinner and trivia night
(with an open bar).  Sitting to my left was Pierre, and to my right
was Jade.  Two more friends: last month, Pierre took me on a tour of
the Facebook campus in Palo Alto, while I was on my way to meet Jade
to go snowboarding in Whistler.  Very good friends.  Our trivia team
name was "The Abusement Park".

Over the next day, there was a mix of activities and group bonding.
There were games and scavenger hunts, but nobody really kept score.  I
can't remember if my teams won anything, because success over the
weekend was measured by how many names you learned (and immediately
forgot).  On Saturday night, there was the long-awaited dance party.
Good vibes and good music filled the room (our DJs have wonderful
taste), as people in costumes threw back free drinks (did I mention
there was an open bar?)

The night only got better as it went on, there were impromptu dance
battles, banter and plenty of laughter.  People stayed up through the
night until the sun rose the next morning, still chatting and laughing
well into Sunday.  More friends.

After a quiet breakfast and some downtime, award nomination sheets
were distributed.  The awards included "Most Bogan" (won, proudly, by
yours truly), "One shot wonder", "Best Costume", "Biggest Win" and
"Biggest Fail".  The awards were fair, fun and everyone had a good
laugh.

Getting back onto the bus to go home, people were helping with each
other's bags, shotgunning seats and falling asleep on each other's
shoulders.  Once we arrived back at UNSW on Sunday afternoon, people
were hugging their new friends and saying "I'll see you tomorrow at
the COMP1917 lecture.  I can't wait."

I went home to watch a replay of the first Waratahs game I had missed
in years.

The camp was well worth it.
