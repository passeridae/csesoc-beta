Whether you're a new student wondering what there is to do at uni
outside of class, or an old soul looking for something different to
experience---never fear; \CSE\ Revue is here!  \CSE\ Revue is a live
sketch comedy show, entirely created, produced, and performed by
students from the society.  The show might be held during September,
but putting together an entertaining show begins now!

Getting involved with \CSE\ Revue is an opportunity to share your
talents and discover ones you didn't know you had.  You'll learn new
skills, make lots of new friends, and above all, have an amazing time!

The society has a wide variety of teams to get involved in: there's
_Cast_, for those who are interested in acting, singing, dancing, or
just being on stage---no prior experience necessary; we'll teach you
everything!  For those with musical inclinations, the show has a live
_Band_.  The _Tech_ team makes the show happen from backstage, running
the stage, lighting, sound, and building sets and props.  The
_Costumes/Makeup_ team ensures the actors look awesome on show nights.

Of course, there wouldn't be a show without content: head to the
_Scripts_ team, bring your creativity, and try your hand at writing;
if you're interested in filming and special effects, the _VFX_ team
shoots and makes videos.  And for the visually artistic, there's the
_Design_ team, which creates cool-looking posters and merchandise.

All the teams vary in the time commitment required: the Cast and Tech
teams require the greatest commitment, while other teams are less
involved, and become more active at different times of the year.

So, if you're looking for something more casual and fun, try one of
the teams: the _Social_ team organises all the fun events that happen
throughout the year; the _Wellbeing_ team is all about food and
ensuring cast and crew are fed during show---a very important task, as
you can imagine!  The _Front of House_ team takes care of the audience
on show nights; the _Publications and Promotions_ team work on getting
word out and marketing the show on campus.  And, last but not least,
for those who want to apply their coding skills, the _Webmin_ team is
responsible for running the society's website and servers.

You can join more than one team, depending on your interests.  No
prior experience is required!  We're looking for people with
enthusiasm and dedication.

\CSE\ Revue is open to students from all faculties.  Get your friends
involved in a fantastic show and experience!  To find out more, drop
