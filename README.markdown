CSESoc βeta
===========

βeta is a fortnightly newsletter produced by CSESoc and containing the
latest and greatest news about computing, UNSW, CSE, and the world
that revolves around you, our reader.  We co-ordinate with other teams
to find out what's going on and report back to you, all in a nicely
packaged newsletter.

Of course, a newsletter without articles is like sliced bread without
the bread; we're always in need of people to help us out by writing
articles that CSE students and staff will find interesting.

We have regular meetings, so if you're not sure what you'd write about
but are interested in being involved, join us and we'll work with you
to figure out what aspect of βeta would be the best fit for you!
