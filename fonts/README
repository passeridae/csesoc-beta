Beta's Fonts
------------

Beta uses Klinic Slab as a body serif, and Roboto as a heading
sans-serif.  You'll need both of these fonts installed and made
available to LuaTeX.

On reasonable systems (including BSDs and Linuxen):

    $ cp $BETA/fonts/*.[to]tf $HOME/.fonts
    $ env OSFONTDIR=$HOME/.fonts mtxrun --script font --reload

On OS X:

    [in Finder, select the fonts, open them, and install them, then]
    $ env OSFONTDIR=$HOME/Library/Fonts mtxrun --script font --reload

On Windows:

    install Linux, then proceed as above.
